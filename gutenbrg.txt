One thing, at least, it clearly is: agreat, rich rush and flood of energy. It is as if the store of lifehad been accumulating through the slow, placid years of childhood,and suddenly the dam had broken and the waters rushed out, furiousand uncontrolled, before settling down into the quieter channels ofmiddle life. The youth is suddenly seized with a poignant consciousnessof being alive, which is quite wanting to the naïve unquestioningexistence of the child. He finds himself overpoweringly urged towardself-expression. Just as the baby, born into a “great, blooming,buzzing confusion,” and attracted by every movement, every color, everysound, kicks madly in response in all directions, and only graduallygets his movements coördinated into the orderly and precise movementsof his elders,--so the youth suddenly born into a confusion of ideasand appeals and traditions responds in the most chaotic way to this newspiritual world, and only gradually learns to find his way about in it,and get his thoughts and feelings into some kind of order.Fortunate the young man who does not make his entrance into too widea world. And upon the width and depth of that new world will dependvery much whether his temperament is to be radical or conservative,adventurous or conventional. For it is one of the surprising thingsabout youth that it can so easily be the most conservative of allages. Why do we suppose that youth is always radical? At no age aresocial proprieties more strictly observed, and Church, State, law, andorder, more rigorously defended. But I like to think that youth isconservative only when its spiritual force has been spent too early,or when the new world it enters into is found, for some reason, to berather narrow and shallow. It is so often the urgent world of pleasurethat first catches the eye of youth; its flood of life is drawn offin that direction; the boy may fritter away his precious birthrightin pure lightness of heart and animal spirits. And it is only tootrue that this type of youth is transitory. Pleasure contrives toburn itself out very quickly, and youth finds itself left prematurelywith the ashes of middle age. But if, in some way, the flood of lifeis checked in the direction of pleasure, then it bursts forth inanother,--in the direction of ideals; then we say that the boy isradical. Youth is always turbulent, but the momentous difference iswhether it shall be turbulent in passion or in enthusiasm. Nothing isso pathetic as the young man who spends his spiritual force too early,so that when the world of ideals is presented to him, his force beingspent, he can only grasp at second-hand ideals and mouldy formulas.This is the great divergence which sets youth not only against oldage, but against youth itself: the undying spirit of youth that seemsto be fed by an unquenchable fire, that does not burn itself out butseems to grow steadier and steadier as life goes on, against thefragile, quickly tarnished type that passes relentlessly into middlelife. At twenty-five I find myself full of the wildest radicalisms,and look with dismay at my childhood friends who are already settleddown, have achieved babies and responsibilities, and have somehow gotten years beyond me in a day. And this divergence shows itself in athousand different ways. It may be a temptation to a world of pleasure,it may be a sheltering from the stimulus of ideas, or even a sluggishtemperament, that separates traditional and adventurous youth, butfundamentally it is a question of how youth takes the world. And here Ifind that I can no longer drag the traditional youth along with me inthis paper. There are many of him, I know, but I do not like him, andI know nothing about him. Let us rather look at the way radical youthgrows into and meets the world.From the state of “the little child, to whom the sky is a roof ofblue, the world a screen of opaque and disconnected facts, thehome a thing eternal, and ‘being good’ just simple obedience tounquestioned authority,” one steps suddenly into that “vast world ofadult perception, pierced deep by flaring search-lights of partialunderstanding.”The child has an utter sense of security; childhood is unconscious eventhat it is alive. It has neither fears nor anxieties, because it isincorrigibly poetical. It idealizes everything that it touches. It isunfair, perhaps, to blame parents and teachers, as we sometimes do inyouth, for consciously biasing our child-minds in a falsely idealisticdirection; for the child will infallibly idealize even his poorest ofexperiences. His broken glimpses and anticipations of his own futureshow him everything that is orderly, happy, and beautifully fit. Hesees his grown-up life as old age, itself a sort of reversed childhood,sees its youth. The passing of childhood into youth is, therefore,like suddenly being turned from the cosy comfort of a warm fireside toshift for one’s self in the world. Life becomes in a moment a processof seeking and searching. It appears as a series of blind alleys, allequally and magnificently alluring, all equally real and possible.Youth’s thirst for experience is simply that it wants to be everything,do everything and have everything that is presented to its imagination.Youth has suddenly become conscious of life. It has eaten of the treeof the knowledge of good and evil.As the world breaks in on a boy with its crashing thunder, he has afeeling of expansion, of sudden wisdom and sudden care. The atoms ofthings seem to be disintegrating around him. Then come the tearings andthe grindings and the wrenchings, and in that conflict the radical orthe poet is made. If the youth takes the struggle easily, or if hisguardian angels have arranged things so that there is no struggle,then he becomes of that conservative stripe that we have renouncedabove. But if he takes it hard,--if his struggles are not only withoutward material conditions, but also with inner spiritual ones,--thenhe is likely to achieve that gift of the gods, perpetual youth. Thegreat paradox is that it is the sleek and easy who are prematurely andpermanently old. Struggle brings youth rather than old age.In this struggle, thus beset with problems and crises, all callingfor immediate solution, youth battles its way into a sort ofrationalization. Out of its inchoateness emerges a sort of order; thedisturbing currents of impulse are gradually resolved into a character.But it is essential that that resolution be a natural and not aforced one. I always have a suspicion of boys who talk of “planningtheir lives.” I feel that they have won a precocious maturity in someillegitimate way. For to most of us youth is so imperious that thosewho can escape the hurly-burly and make a sudden leap into the prudent,quiet waters of life seem to have missed youth altogether. And I donot mean here the hurly-burly of passion so much as of ideals. Itseems so much better, as well as more natural, to expose one’s self tothe full fury of the spiritual elements, keeping only one purpose inview,--to be strong and sincere,--than to pick one’s way cautiouslyalong.The old saying is the truest philosophy of youth: “Seek ye firstthe Kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you.”How impossible for a youth who is really young to plan his lifeconsciously! This process that one sometimes sees of cautiouslybecoming acquainted with various ideas and systems, and then choosingdeliberately those that will be best adapted to a concerted plan,is almost uncanny. This confidence in one’s immunity to ideas thatwould tend to disarrange the harmony of the scheme is mystifying andirritating. Youth talks of “getting” or “accepting” ideas! But youthdoes not get ideas,--ideas get him! He may try to keep himself in astate of spiritual health, but that is the only immunity he can relyupon. He cannot really tell what idea or appeal is going to seize uponhim next and make off with him.We speak as if falling in love were a unique phase in the life ofyouth. It is rather the pattern and symbol of a youth’s whole life.This sudden, irresistible seizure of enthusiasm that he cannot explain,that he does not want to explain, what is it but the aspect of all hisexperience? The youth sees a pretty face, reads a noble book, hears astirring appeal for a cause, meets a charming friend, gets fired withthe concept of science, or of social progress, becomes attracted toa profession,--the emotion that fixes his enthusiasm and lets out aflood of emotion in that direction, and lifts him into another world,is the same in every case. Youth glories in the sudden servitude,is content to let the new master lead wherever he will; and is assurprised as any one at the momentous and startling results. Youth isvulnerable at every point. Prudence is really a hateful thing in youth.A prudent youth is prematurely old. It is infinitely better, I repeat,for a boy to start ahead in life in a spirit of moral adventure,trusting for sustenance to what he may find by the wayside, than tolay in laboriously, before starting, a stock of principles for life,and burden himself so heavily for the journey that he dare not, andindeed cannot, leave his pack unguarded by the roadside to survey thefair prospects on either hand. Youth at its best is this constantsusceptibility to the new, this constant eagerness to try experiments.It is here that youth’s quarrel with the elder generation comes in.There is no scorn so fierce as that of youth for the inertia ofolder men. The lack of adjustment to the ideas of youth’s elders andbetters, one of the permanent tragedies of life, is certainly the mostsensational aspect of youth. That the inertia of the older people iswisdom, and not impotence, is a theory that you will never induceyouth to believe for an instant. The stupidity and cruelties of theirmanagement of the world fill youth with an intolerant rage. In everycontact with its elders, youth finds them saying, in the words ofKipling:--  “We shall not acknowledge that old stars fade and alien planets arise,  That the sere bush buds or the desert blooms or the ancient well-head   dries,  Or any new compass wherewith new men adventure ’neath new skies.”Youth sees with almost a passionate despair its plans and dreams andenthusiasms, that it knows so well to be right and true and noble,brushed calmly aside, not because of any sincere searching into theirpracticability, but because of the timidity and laziness of the old,who sit in the saddle and ride mankind. And nothing torments youth somuch as to have this inertia justified on the ground of experience.For youth thinks that it sees through this sophism of “experience.”It sees in it an all-inclusive attempt to give the world a character,and excuse the older generation for the mistakes and failures which ithas made. What is this experience, youth asks, but a slow accretion ofinhibitions, a learning, at its best, not to do again something whichought not to have been done in the first place?Old men cherish a fond delusion that there is something mysticallyvaluable in mere quantity of experience. Now the fact is, of course,that it is the young people who have all the really valuableexperience. It is they who have constantly to face new situations, toreact constantly to new aspects of life, who are getting the wholebeauty and terror and cruelty of the world in its fresh and undilutedpurity. It is only the interpretation of this first collision with lifethat is worth anything. For the weakness of experience is that it sosoon gets stereotyped; without new situations and crises it becomes soconventional as to be practically unconscious. Very few people get anyreally new experience after they are twenty-five, unless there is areal change of environment. Most older men live only in the experienceof their youthful years.If we get few ideas after we are twenty-five, we get few ideals afterwe are twenty. A man’s spiritual fabric is woven by that time, andhis “experience,” if he keeps true to himself, consists simply inbroadening and enriching it, but not in adding to it in arithmeticalproportion as the years roll on, in the way that the wise teachers ofyouth would have us believe.But few men remain quite true to themselves. As their youthful idealscome into contact with the harshnesses of life, the brightest succumband go to the wall. And the hardy ones that survive contain all thatis vital in the future experience of the man,--so that the ideas ofolder men seem often the curious parodies or even burlesques of whatmust have been the cleaner and more potent ideas of their youth.Older people seem often to be resting on their oars, drifting on thespiritual current that youth has set going in life, or “coasting” onthe momentum that the strong push of youth has given them.There is no great gulf between youth and middle age, as there isbetween childhood and youth. Adults are little more than grown-upchildren. This is what makes their arrogance so insulting,--theassumption that they have acquired any impartiality or objectivity ofoutlook, and have any better standards for judging life. Their ideasare wrong, and grow progressively more wrong as they become older.Youth, therefore, has no right to be humble. The ideals it forms willbe the highest it will ever have, the insight the clearest, the ideasthe most stimulating. The best that it can hope to do is to conservethose resources, and keep its flame of imagination and daring bright.Therefore, it is perhaps unfair to say that the older generation rulesthe world. Youth rules the world, but only when it is no longer young.It is a tarnished, travestied youth that is in the saddle in the personof middle age. Old age lives in the delusion that it has improved andrationalized its youthful ideas by experience and stored-up wisdom,when all it has done is to damage them more or less--usually more. Andthe tragedy of life is that the world is run by these damaged ideals.That is why our ideas are always a generation behind our actual socialconditions. Press, pulpit, and bar teem with the radicalisms ofthirty years ago. The dead hand of opinions formed in their collegedays clutches our leaders and directs their activities in this new andstrangely altered physical and spiritual environment. Hence grievousfriction, maladjustment, social war. And the faster society moves, themore terrific is the divergence between what is actually going on andwhat public opinion thinks is actually going on. It is only the youngwho are actually contemporaneous; they interpret what they see freshlyand without prejudice; their vision is always the truest, and theirinterpretation always the justest.Youth does not simply repeat the errors and delusions of the past, asthe elder generation with a tolerant cynicism likes to think; it isever laying the foundations for the future. What it thinks so wildlynow will be orthodox gospel thirty years hence. The ideas of the youngare the living, the potential ideas; those of the old, the dying, orthe already dead. This is why it behooves youth to be not less radical,but even more radical, than it would naturally be. It must be notsimply contemporaneous, but a generation ahead of the times, so thatwhen it comes into control of the world, it will be precisely rightand coincident with the conditions of the world as it finds them. Ifthe youth of to-day could really achieve this miracle, they would havefound the secret of “perpetual youth.”       *       *       *       *       *In this conflict between youth and its elders, youth is the incarnationof reason pitted against the rigidity of tradition. Youth puts theremorseless questions to everything that is old and established,--Why?What is this thing good for? And when it gets the mumbled, evasiveanswers of the defenders, it applies its own fresh, clean spirit ofreason to institutions, customs, and ideas, and, finding them stupid,inane, or poisonous, turns instinctively to overthrow them and build intheir place the things with which its visions teem.“This constant return to purely logical activity with each generationkeeps the world supplied with visionaries and reformers, that isto say, with saviors and leaders. New movements are born in youngminds, and lack of experience enables youth eternally to recallcivilization to sound bases. The passing generation smiles andcracks its weather-worn jokes about youthful effusions: but thisnew, ever-hopeful, ever-daring, ever-doing, youthful enthusiasm,ever returning to the logical bases of religion, ethics, politics,business, art, and social life,--this is the salvation of theworld.”[1]This was the youthful radicalism of Jesus, and his words sound acrossthe ages “calling civilization ever back to sound bases.” With him,youth eternally reproaches the ruling generation,--“O ye of littlefaith!” There is so much to be done in the world; so much could be doneif you would only dare! You seem to be doing so little to cure thewaste and the muddle and the lethargy all around you. Don’t you reallycare, or are you only faint-hearted? If you do not care, it must bebecause you do not know; let us point out to you the shockingness ofexploitation, and the crass waste of human personality all around youin this modern world. And if you are faint-hearted, we will supply theneeded daring and courage, and lead you straight to the attack.These are the questions and challenges that the youth puts to hiselders, and it is their shifty evasions and quibblings that confoundand dishearten him. He becomes intolerant, and can see all classes inno other light than that of accomplices in a great crime. If they onlyknew! Swept along himself in an irrationality of energy, he does notsee the small part that reason plays in the intricate social life, andonly gradually does he come to view life as a “various and splendiddisorder of forces,” and exonerate weak human nature from some of itsheavy responsibility. But this insight brings him to appreciate andalmost to reverence the forces of science and conscious social progressthat are grappling with that disorder, and seeking to tame it.Youth is the leaven that keeps all these questioning, testing attitudesfermenting in the world. If it were not for this troublesome activityof youth, with its hatred of sophisms and glosses, its insistence onthings as they are, society would die from sheer decay. It is thepolicy of the older generation as it gets adjusted to the world tohide away the unpleasant things where it can, or preserve a conspiracyof silence and an elaborate pretense that they do not exist. Butmeanwhile the sores go on festering just the same. Youth is the drasticantiseptic. It will not let its elders cry peace, where there is nopeace. Its fierce sarcasms keep issues alive in the world until theyare settled right. It drags skeletons from closets and insists thatthey be explained. No wonder the older generation fears and distruststhe younger. Youth is the avenging Nemesis on its trail. “It is youngmen who provide the logic, decision, and enthusiasm necessary torelieve society of the crushing burden that each generation seeks toroll upon the shoulders of the next.”Our elders are always optimistic in their views of the present,pessimistic in their views of the future; youth is pessimistic towardthe present and gloriously hopeful for the future. And it is thishope which is the lever of progress,--one might say, the only leverof progress. The lack of confidence which the ruling generation feelsin the future leads to that distrust of the machinery of socialreform and social organization, or the use of means for ends, whichis so characteristic of it to-day. Youth is disgusted with suchsentimentality. It can never understand that curious paralysis whichseizes upon its elders in the face of urgent social innovations; thatrefusal to make use of a perfectly definite programme or administrativescheme which has worked elsewhere. Youth concludes that its eldersdiscountenance the machinery, the means, because they do not reallybelieve in the end, and adds another count to the indictment.Youth’s attitude is really the scientific attitude. Do not be afraidto make experiments, it says. You cannot tell how anything will workuntil you have tried it. Suppose science confined its interests tothose things that have been tried and tested in the world, how farshould we get? It is possible indeed that your experiments may produceby accident a social explosion, but we do not give up chemistry becauseoccasionally a wrong mixture of chemicals blows up a scientist in alaboratory, or medical research because an investigator contracts thedisease he is fighting. The whole philosophy of youth is summed up inthe word, Dare! Take chances and you will attain! The world has nothingto lose but its chains--and its own soul to gain!       *       *       *       *       *I have dwelt too long on the conflicts of youth. For it has also itsstill places, where it becomes introspective and thinks about itsdestiny and the meaning of its life. In our artificial civilizationmany young people at twenty-five are still on the threshold ofactivity. As one looks back, then, over eight or nine years, one seesa panorama of seemingly formidable length. So many crises, so manystartling surprises, so many vivid joys and harrowing humiliations anddisappointments, that one feels startlingly old; one wonders if onewill ever feel so old again. And in a sense, youth at twenty-five isolder than it will ever be again. For if time is simply a successionof incidents in our memory, we seem to have an eternity behind us.Middle-aged people feel no such appalling stretch of time behind them.The years fade out one by one; often the pressure of life leavesnothing of reality or value but the present moment. Some of youth’selders seem to enjoy almost a new babyhood, while youth has constantlywith it in all its vividness and multifariousness that specious wealthof abrupt changes, climaxes and disillusions that have crowded theshort space of its life.We often envy the sunny noon of the thirties and forties. These eldersof ours change so little that they seem to enjoy an endless summerof immortality. They are so placid, so robust, so solidly placed inlife, seemingly so much further from dissolution than we. Youth seemscuriously fragile. Perhaps it is because all beauty has somethingof the precarious and fleeting about it. A beautiful girl seems toodelicate and fine to weather a long life; she must be burning awaytoo fast. This wistfulness and haunting pathos of life is very realto youth. It feels the rush of time past it. Only youth can sing ofthe passing glory of life, and then only in its full tide. The olderpeople’s lament for the vanished days of youth may be orthodox, but itrings hollow. For our greatest fears are those of presentiment, andyouth is haunted not only by the feeling of past change, but by thepresentiment of future change.Middle age has passed the waters; it has become static and placid.Its wistfulness for youth is unreal, and a forced sentimentality.In the same breath that it cries for its youth it mocks at youth’spreoccupation with the thought of death. The lugubrious harmonies ofyoung poets are a favorite joke. But the feeling of the precariousnessof life gives the young man an intimate sense of its preciousness;nothing shocks him quite so much as that it should be ruthlessly andinstantly snatched away. Middle age has acclimated itself to theearth, has settled down familiarly in it, and is easily be fooled intothinking that it will live here forever, just as, when we are settledcomfortably in a house, we cannot conceive ourselves as ever beingdislodged. But youth takes a long time to get acclimated. It has seenso many mysteries and dangers about it, that the presence of theGreatest Mystery and the Greatest Danger must be the most portentous ofthings to it.It is this sense of the preciousness of his life, perhaps, that makesa youth so impatient of discipline. Youth can never think of itselfas anything but master of things. Its visions are a curious blend ofdevotion and egotism. Its enthusiasm for a noble cause is apt to be allmixed up with a picture of itself leading the cohorts to victory. Theyouth never sees himself as a soldier in the ranks, but as the leader,bringing in some long-awaited change by a brilliant _coup d’état_,or writing and speaking words of fire that win a million hearts at astroke. And he fights shy of discipline in smaller matters. He does notsubmit willingly to a course of work that is not immediately appealing,even for the sake of the glorious final achievement. Fortunate it isfor the young man, perhaps, that there are so many organs of coercionall ready in the world for him,--economic need, tradition, and subtleinfluence of family ambition,--to seize him and nail him fast to someprofession or trade or activity, before he is aware, or has time toprotest or draw back!It is another paradox of youth that, with all its fine enthusiasm, itshould accomplish so little. But this seeming aimlessness of purposeis the natural result of that deadly fear of having one’s wings clippedby discipline. Infinitely finer, it seems to youth, is it to soarfreely in the air, than to run on a track along the ground! And perhapsyouth is right. In his intellectual life, the young man’s scorn for thepedantic and conventional amounts almost to an obsession. It is onlythe men of imagination and inspiration that he will follow at all. Butmost of these professors, these lawyers, these preachers,--what hasbeen their training and education, he says, but a gradual losing ofthe grip of life, a slow withdrawing into an ideal world of phrasesand concepts and artificial attitudes? Their thought seems like theendless spinning out of a spider’s web, or like the camel living uponthe fat of his own hump. The youth fears this sophistication of thoughtas he would fear losing his soul. And this seeming perversity towarddiscipline is often simply his refusal to let a system submerge his ownreal and direct reactions to his observation and experience.And yet as he studies more and more, and acquires a richer materialfor thought, a familiarity with words, and a skill in handling them,he can see the insidious temptation that comes to thinking men tomove all their spiritual baggage over into that fascinating unrealworld. And he admires almost with reverence the men who have been ableto break through the terrible crust, and have got their thinking intoclose touch with life again; or, best of all, those who have kepttheir thinking constantly checked up with life, and are occupied withinterpreting what they see about them. Youth will never be able to seethat this is not the only true and right business of thought.It is the glory of the present age that in it one can be young.Our times give no check to the radical tendencies of youth. On thecontrary, they give the directest stimulation. A muddle of a world anda wide outlook combine to inspire us to the bravest of radicalisms.Great issues have been born in the last century, and are now loosein the world. There is a radical philosophy that illuminates ourenvironment, gives us terms in which to express what we see, andcoördinates our otherwise aimless reactions.In this country, it is true, where a certain modicum of freeinstitutions, and a certain specious enfranchisement of the humanspirit have been achieved, youth may be blinded and drugged into anacquiescence in conditions, and its enthusiasm may easily run into aglorification of the present. In the face of the more urgent idealsthat are with us, it may be inspired by vague ideas of “liberty,” or“the rights of man,” and fancy it is truly radical when it is butliving on the radicalisms of the past. Our political thought moves soslowly here that even our radicalism is traditional. We breathe in withthe air about us the belief that we have attained perfection, and we donot examine things with our own eyes.But more and more of the clear-sighted youth are coming to see theappalling array of things that still need to be done. The radical youngman of to-day has no excuse for veering round to the conservativestandpoint. Cynicism cannot touch him. For it is the beauty of themodern radical philosophy that the worse the world treats a man, themore it convinces him of the truth of his radical interpretation ofit. Disillusion comes, not through hard blows, but by the insidioussappings of worldly success. And there never was a time when therewere so many radical young people who cared little about that worldlysuccess.The secret of life is then that this fine youthful spirit shouldnever be lost. Out of the turbulence of youth should come this fineprecipitate--a sane, strong, aggressive spirit of daring and doing. Itmust be a flexible, growing spirit, with a hospitality to new ideas,and a keen insight into experience. To keep one’s reactions warm andtrue, is to have found the secret of perpetual youth, and perpetualyouth is salvation.FOOTNOTES:[1] Earl Barnes.IITHE TWO GENERATIONSIt is always interesting to see ourselves through the eyes of others,even though that view may be most unflattering. The recent “Letter tothe Rising Generation,”[2] if I may judge from the well-thumbed andunderscored copy of the “Atlantic” which I picked up in the CollegeLibrary, has been read with keen interest by many of my fellows, anddoubtless, too, with a more emphatic approval, by our elders. Theindictment of an entire generation must at its best be a difficulttask, but the author of the article has performed it with considerablecircumspection, skirting warily the vague and the abstract, and passingfrom the judge’s bench to the pulpit with a facility that indicatesthat justice is to be tempered with mercy. The rather appalling picturewhich she draws of past generations holding their breath to see whatmy contemporaries will make of themselves suggests, too, that we arestill on probation, and so, before final judgment is passed, it may bepertinent to attempt, if not, from the hopeless nature of the case, adefense, at least an extenuation of ourselves.The writer’s charge is pretty definite. It is to the effect that therising generation, in its reaction upon life and the splendid worldwhich has been handed down to it, shows a distinct softening of humanfibre, spiritual, intellectual, and physical, in comparison with thegenerations which have preceded it. The most obvious retort to thisis, of course, that the world in which we find ourselves is in no wayof our own making, so that if our reactions to it are unsatisfactory,or our rebellious attitude toward it distressing, it is at least aplausible assumption that the world itself, despite the responsiblecare which the passing generation bestowed upon it, may be partly toblame.But this, after all, is only begging the question. The author herselfadmits that we are the victims of educational experiments, and, in anyevent, each generation is equally guiltless of its world. We recognizewith her that the complexity of the world we face only makes morenecessary our bracing up for the fray. Her charge that we are not doingthis overlooks, however, certain aspects of the situation which go farto explain our seemingly deplorable qualities.The most obvious fact which presents itself in this connection isthat the rising generation has practically brought itself up. Schooldiscipline, since the abolition of corporal punishment, has becomealmost nominal; church discipline practically nil; and even homediscipline, although retaining the forms, is but an empty shell.The modern child from the age of ten is almost his own master. Thehelplessness of the modern parent face to face with these conditions isamusing. What generation but the one to which our critic belongs couldhave conceived of “mothers’ clubs” conducted by the public schools,in order to teach mothers how to bring up their children! The modernparent has become a sort of _parlement_ registering the decrees of aGrand Monarque, and occasionally protesting, though usually withouteffect, against a particularly drastic edict.I do not use this assertion as a text for an indictment of thepreceding generation; I am concerned, like our critic, only withresults. These are a peculiarly headstrong and individualisticcharacter among the young people, and a complete bewilderment on thepart of the parents. The latter frankly do not understand theirchildren, and their lack of understanding and of control over themmeans a lack of the moral guidance which, it has always been assumed,young people need until they are safely launched in the world. The twogenerations misunderstand each other as they never did before. Thisfact is a basal one to any comprehension of the situation.Now let us see how the rising generation brings itself up. It isperfectly true that the present-day secondary education, that curiousfragmentary relic of a vitally humanistic age, does not appeal to them.They will tell you frankly that they do not see any use in it. Havingbrought themselves up, they judge utility by their own standards, andnot by those of others. Might not the fact that past generations wentwith avidity to their multiplication table, their Latin Grammar, andtheir English Bible, whereas the rising generation does not, imply thatthe former found some intellectual sustenance in those things which thelatter fails to find? The appearance of industrial education on thefield, and the desperate attempts of educational theory to make the oldthings palatable which fifty years ago were gulped down raw, argues,too, that there may be a grain of truth in our feeling. Only after aserious examination of our intellectual and spiritual viands shouldour rejection of them be attributed to a disordered condition of ourstomachs.The charge that the rising generation betrays an extraordinary loveof pleasure is also true. The four years’ period of high-school lifeamong the children of the comfortable classes is, instead of being apreparation for life, literally one round of social gayety. But it isnot likely that this is because former generations were less eagerfor pleasure, but rather because they were more rigidly repressedby parents and custom, while their energy was directed into otherchannels, religious, for instance. But now, with every barrier removed,we have the unique spectacle of a youthful society where there isperfectly free intercourse, an unforced social life of equals, inwhich there are bound to develop educative influences of profoundsignificance. Social virtues will be learned better in such a societythan they can ever be from moral precepts. An important result of thiscamaraderie is that the boy’s and the girl’s attitude toward life,their spiritual outlook, has come to be the same. The line between thetwo “spheres” has long disappeared in the industrial classes; it isnow beginning to fade among the comfortable classes.Our critic has not seen that this avidity for pleasure is a naturalebullition which, flaring up naturally, within a few years as naturallysubsides. It goes, too, without that ennui of over-stimulation; andthe fact that it has been will relieve us of the rising generationfrom feeling that envy which invariably creeps into the tone of thepassing generation when they say, “We did not go such a pace when wewere young.” After this period of pleasure has begun to subside, thereensues for those who have not been prematurely forced into industry, astrange longing for independence. This feeling is most striking amongthe girls of the rising generation, and crops up in the most unexpectedplaces, in families in the easiest circumstances, where to thepreceding generation the idea of caring to do anything except stay athome and get married, if possible, would have been inconceivable. Theywant somehow to feel that they are standing on their own feet. Liketheir brothers, they begin to chafe under the tutelage, nominal thoughit is, of the home. As a result, these daughters of the comfortableclasses go into trained nursing, an occupation which twenty years agowas deemed hardly respectable; or study music, or do settlement work,or even public-school teaching. Of course, girls who have had to earntheir own living have long done these things; the significant point isthat the late rapid increase in these professions comes from those whohave a comfortable niche in society all prepared for them. I do notargue that this proves any superior quality of character on the part ofthis generation, but it does at least fail to suggest a desire to leadlives of ignoble sloth.The undergraduate feels this spirit, too. He often finds himselfvaguely dissatisfied with what he has acquired, and yet does notquite know what else would have been better for him. He stands on thethreshold of a career, with a feeling of boundless possibility, and yetoften without a decided bent toward any particular thing. One could doalmost anything were one given the opportunity, and yet, after all,just what shall one do? Our critics have some very hard things to sayabout this attitude. They attribute it to an egotistic philosophy,imperfectly absorbed. But may it not rather be the result of thatabsence of repression in our bringing-up, of that rigid moulding whichmade our grandfathers what they were?It must be remembered that we of the rising generation have to workthis problem out alone. Pastors, teachers, and parents flutteraimlessly about with their ready-made formulas, but somehow theseare less efficacious than they used to be. I doubt if any generationwas ever thrown quite so completely on its own resources as oursis. Through it all, the youth as well as the girl feels that hewants to count for something in life. His attitude, which seems soegotistical to his elders, is the result of this and of a certainexpansive outlook, rather than of any love of vain-glory. He has neverknown what it was to be moulded, and he shrinks a little perhapsfrom going through that process. The traditional professions havelost some of their automatic appeal. They do conventionalize, andfurthermore, the youth, looking at many of their representatives,the men who “count” in the world to-day, may be pardoned if he feelssometimes as if he did not want to count in just that way. The youth“who would not take special training because it would interfere withhis sacred individuality” is an unfair caricature of this weighing,testing attitude toward the professions. The elder generation shouldremember that life is no longer the charted sea that it was toour grandfathers, and be accordingly lenient with us of the risinggeneration.Business, to the youth standing on the threshold of life, presents asimilar dilemma. Too often it seems like a choice between the routineof a mammoth impersonal corporation and chicanery of one kind oranother, or the living by one’s wits within the pale of honesty. Thepredatory individualist, the “hard-as-nails” specimen, does exist, ofcourse, but we are justified in ignoring him here; for, however muchhis tribe may increase, it is certain that it will not be his kind, butthe more spiritually sensitive, the amorphous ones of the generation,who will impress some definite character upon the age, and ultimatelycount for good or evil, as a social force. With these latter, it shouldbe noted that, although this is regarded as a mercenary age, thequestion of gain, to an increasingly large number, has little to dowith the final decision.The economic situation in which we find ourselves, and to which notonly the free, of whom we have been speaking, but also the unfree ofthe rising generation are obliged to react, is perhaps the biggestfactor in explaining our character. In this reaction the risinggeneration has a very real feeling of coming straight up against awall of diminishing opportunity. I do not see how it can be deniedthat practical opportunity is less for this generation than it hasbeen for those preceding it. The man of fifty years ago, if he wasintellectually inclined, was able to get his professional trainingat small expense, and usually under the personal guidance of hiselders; if commercially inclined, he could go into a small, settled,self-respecting business house, practically a profession in itselfand a real school of character. If he had a broader outlook, therewas the developing West for him, or the growing industrialism of theEast. It looks, at least from this distance, as if opportunity wereeasy for that generation. They had the double advantage of beingmore circumscribed in their outlook, and of possessing more readyopportunity at hand.But these times have passed forever. Nowadays, professional training islengthy and expensive; independent business requires big capital forsuccess; and there is no more West. It is still as true as ever thatthe exceptional man will always “get there,” but now it is likely to beonly the exceptional man, whereas formerly all the able “got there,”too. The only choice for the vast majority of the young men of to-dayis between being swallowed up in the routine of a big corporation, andexperiencing the vicissitudes of a small business, which is now anuncertain, rickety affair, usually living by its wits, in the handsof men who are forced to subordinate everything to self-preservation,and in which the employee’s livelihood is in constant jeopardy. Thegrowing consciousness of this situation explains many of the peculiarcharacteristics of our generation.It has a direct bearing on the question of responsibility. Is itnot sound doctrine that one becomes responsible only by being maderesponsible for something? Now, what incentive to responsibility isproduced by the industrial life of to-day? In the small business thereis the frank struggle for gain between employer and employee, a contestof profits vs. wages, each trying to get the utmost possible out of theother. The only kind of responsibility that this can possibly breedis the responsibility for one’s own subsistence. In the big business,the employee is simply a small part of a big machine; his workcounts for so little that he can rarely be made to feel any intimateresponsibility for it.Then, too, our haphazard industrial system offers such magnificentopportunities to a young man to get into the wrong place. He is forcedby necessity to go early, without the least training or interest, intothe first work that offers itself. The dull, specialized routine ofthe modern shop or office, so different from the varied work and thepersonal touch which created interest in the past, is the last thingon earth that will mould character or produce responsibility. When thesituation with an incentive appears, however, we are as ready as anygeneration, I believe, to meet it.I have seen too many young men, of the usual futile bringing-up andnegligible training, drift idly about from one “job” to another,without apparent ambition, until something happened to be presentedto them which had a spark of individuality about it, whereupon theyfaced about and threw themselves into the task with an energy thatbrought success and honor,--I have seen too much of this not to wonder,somewhat impiously perhaps, whether this boasted character of ourfathers was not rather the result of their coming into contact withthe proper stimulus at the proper time, than of any tougher, grittierstrain in their spiritual fibre. Those among our elders, who, deploringSocialism, insist so strenuously on the imperfections of human nature,ought not to find fault with the theory that frail humanity is underthe necessity of receiving the proper stimulus before developing a goodcharacter or becoming responsible.Nor is the rising generation any the less capable of effort whenconditions call it forth. I wonder how our critic accounts for thecorrespondence schools which have sprung up so abundantly within thepast fifteen years. They are patronized by large numbers of young menand women who have had little academic training and have gone earlyinto industry. It is true that the students do not spend their time onthe Latin grammar; they devote themselves to some kind of technicalcourse which they have been led to believe will qualify them for abetter position. But the fact that they are thus willing to devotetheir spare time to study certainly does not indicate a lack of effort.Rather, it is the hardest kind of effort, for it is directed toward noimmediate end, and, more than that, it is superimposed on the ordinarywork, which is usually quite arduous enough to fatigue the youth.Young apprentices in any branch where there is some kind of technicalor artistic appeal, such as mechanics or architecture, show an almostincredible capacity of effort, often spending, as I have seen themdo, whole days over problems. I know too a young man who, appointedvery young to political office, found that the law would be usefulto him, and travels every evening to a near-by city to take courses.His previous career had been most inglorious, well calculated by itsaimlessness to ruin any “character”; but the incentive was applied, andhe proved quite capable of putting forth a surprising amount of steadyeffort.Our critics are perhaps misled by the fact that these young men donot announce with a blare of trumpets that they are about to followin the footsteps of an Edison or a Webster. It must be admitted thateven such men as I have cited do still contrive to work into theirtime a surprising amount of pleasure. But the whole situation showsconclusively, I think, that our author has missed the point when shesays that the rising generation shows a real softening of the humanfibre. It is rather that we have the same reserves of ability andeffort, but that from the complex nature of the economic situationthese reserves are not unlocked so early or so automatically as withformer generations.The fact that our fathers did not need correspondence schools or nightschools, or such things, implies either that they were not so anxiousas we to count in the world, or that success was an easier matterin their day, either of which conclusions furnishes a pretty goodextenuation of our apparent incapacity. We cannot but believe that ourdifficulties are greater in this generation; it is hard to see that theeffort we put forth to overcome these difficulties is not proportionalto that increase. I am aware that to blame your surroundings when thefault lies in your own character is the one impiety which rouses thehorror of present-day moral teachers. Can it not count to us for good,then, that most of us, while coming theoretically to believe that thiseconomic situation explains so much of our trouble, yet continue to actas if our deficiencies were all our own fault?Our critics are misled by the fact that we do not talk aboutunselfishness and self-sacrifice and duty, as their generationapparently used to do, and conclude that we do not know what thesethings mean. It is true that we do not fuss and fume about our souls,or tend our characters like a hot-house plant. This is a changing,transitional age, and our view is outward rather than inward. In anage of newspapers, free libraries, and cheap magazines, we necessarilyget a broader horizon than the passing generation had. We see what isgoing on in the world, and we get the clash of different points ofview, to an extent which was impossible to our fathers. We cannot beblamed for acquiring a suspicion of ideals, which, however powerfultheir appeal once was, seem singularly impotent now, or if we seek formotive forces to replace them, or for new terms in which to restatethe world. We have an eagerness to understand the world in which welive that amounts almost to a passion. We want to get behind thescenes, to see how the machinery of the modern world actually works.We are curious to learn what other people are thinking, and to getat the forces that have produced their point of view. We dabble inphilanthrophy as much from curiosity to see how people live as from anyfeeling of altruism. We read all sorts of strange philosophies to getthe personal testimony of men who are interpreting the world. In thelast analysis, we have a passion to understand why people act as theydo.We have, as a result, become impatient with the conventionalexplanations of the older generation. We have retained from childhoodthe propensity to see through things, and to tell the truth withstartling frankness. This must, of course, be very disconcerting toa generation, so much of whose activity seems to consist in glossingover the unpleasant things or hiding the blemishes on the fair faceof civilization. There are too many issues evaded which we wouldlike to meet. Many of us find, sooner or later, that the world is avery different sort of place from what our carefully deodorized andidealized education would have us believe.When we find things simply not as they are painted, is it any wonderthat we turn to the new prophets rather than to the old? We are morethan half confident that the elder generation does not itself reallybelieve all the conventional ideals which it seeks to force upon us,and much of our presumption is a result of the contempt we naturallyfeel for such timorousness. Too many of your preachers seem to bewhistling simply to keep up your courage. The plain truth is that theyounger generation is acquiring a positive faith, in contact withwhich the elder generation with its nerveless negations feels itshelplessness without knowing just what to do about it except to scoldthe young.This positive aspect is particularly noticeable in the religion of therising generation. As our critic says, the religious thinking of thepreceding generation was destructive and uncertain. We are demanding adefinite faith, and our spiritual centre is rapidly shifting from thepersonal to the social in religion. Not personal salvation, but social;not our own characters, but the character of society, is our interestand concern. We feel social injustice as our fathers felt personal sin.Settlement work and socialist propaganda, things done fifty years agoonly by rare and heroic souls like Kingsley, Ruskin, and Maurice, arenow the commonplaces of the undergraduate.The religion that will mean anything to the rising generation will bebased on social ideals. An essay like ex-President Eliot’s “Religionof the Future,” which in a way synthesizes science and history andthese social ideals and gives them the religious tinge which every agedemands, supplies a real working religious platform to many a youngman and woman of the rising generation, and an inspiration of whichour elders can form no conception. Perhaps it is unfair to call thisreligion at all. Perhaps it is simply the scientific attitude towardthe world. But I am sure that it is more than this; I am sure thatit is the scientific attitude tinged with the religious that will beours of the rising generation. We find that we cannot keep apart ourreligion, our knowledge, our practice, and our hopes in water-tightcompartments, as our ancestors did. We are beginning to show anincorrigible tendency to work our spiritual assimilations into oneintelligible, constructive whole.It is to this attitude rather than to a softening of fibre that I thinkwe may lay our growing disinclination to deify sacrifice and suffering.A young chemistry student said to me the other day, “Science means thatnothing must be wasted!” This idea somehow gets mixed up with humanexperience, and we come to believe that human life and happiness arethings that must not be wasted. Might it not be that such a belief thathuman waste of life and happiness was foolish and unnecessary wouldpossibly be of some avail in causing that waste to disappear? And oneof the most inspiring of the prophets to the rising generation, WilliamJames, has told us that certain “moral equivalents” of these things arepossible which will prevent that incurable decaying of fibre which theelder generation so anxiously fears.Another result of this attitude is our growing belief in politicalmachinery. We are demanding of our preachers that they reduce qualityto quantity. “Stop talking about liberty and justice and love, and showus institutions, or concerted attempts to model institutions that shallbe free or just or lovely,” we cry. You have been trying so long toreform the world by making men “good,” and with such little success,that we may be pardoned if we turn our attention to the machinery ofsociety, and give up for a time the attempt to make the operators ofthat machinery strictly moral. Indeed, the charm of Socialism to somany of the rising generation is just that scientific aspect of it,its claim of historical basis, and its very definite and concreteorganization for the attainment of its ends. A philosophy which givesan illuminating interpretation of the present, and a vision of thefuture, with a definitely crystallized plan of action with concretemethods, however unsound it may all be, can hardly be said to appealsimply to the combination of “a weak head, a soft heart, and a desireto shirk.”Placed in such a situation as we are, and with such an attitudetoward the world, we are as interested as you and the breathlessgenerations behind you to see what destinies we shall work out forourselves. An unpleasantly large proportion of our energy is nowdrained off in fighting the fetishes which you of the elder generationhave passed along to us, and which, out of some curious instinct ofself-preservation, you so vigorously defend. We, on the other hand,are becoming increasingly doubtful whether you believe in yourselvesquite so thoroughly as you would have us think. Your words are verybrave, but the tone is hollow. Your mistrust of us, and your reluctanceto convey over to us any of your authority in the world, looks alittle too much like the fear and dislike that doubt always feels inthe presence of conviction, to be quite convincing. We believe inourselves; and this fact, we think, is prophetic for the future. Wehave an indomitable feeling that we shall attain, or if not, that weshall pave the way for a generation that shall attain.Meanwhile our constructive work is hampered by your distrust, whileyou blame us for our lack of accomplishment. Is this an attitudecalculated to increase our responsibility and our self-respect? Wouldit not be better in every way, more constructive and more fruitful, tohelp us in our aspirations and endeavors, or, failing that, at least tostrive to understand just what those aspirations and endeavors are?FOOTNOTES:[2] _The Atlantic Monthly_, February, 1911.IIITHE VIRTUES AND THE SEASONS OF LIFEEach season of life has its proper virtues, as each season of the yearhas its own climate and temperature. If virtue is the excellent workingof the soul, then youth, middle age, and old age, all have theirpeculiar ways of working excellently. When we speak of a virtuous life,we should mean, not a life that has shown one single thread of motiveand attitude running through it, but rather one that has varied withthe seasons, as spring grows gently into summer and summer into autumn,each season working excellently in respect to the tilling and harvestof the soul. If it is a virtue to be contented in old age, it is novirtue to be contented in youth; if it is a virtue for youth to be boldand venturesome, it is the virtue of middle life to take heed and beginto gather up the lines and nets so daringly cast by youth into the seaof life. A virtuous life means a life responsive to its powers and itsopportunities, a life not of inhibitions, but of a straining up tothe limit of its strength. It means doing every year what is fittingto be done at that year to enhance or conserve one’s own life or thehappiness of those around one. Virtue is a word that abolishes duty.For duty has steadily fallen into worse and worse opprobrium; it hascome to mean nothing but effort and stress. It implies something thatis done rightly, but that cuts straight across the grain of all one’sinclinations and motive forces. It is following the lines of greatestresistance; it is the working of the moral machine with the utmostfriction possible. Now there is no doubt that the moral life involvesstruggle and effort, but it should be the struggle of adequate choice,and not of painful inhibition. We are coming to see that the mosteffective things we do are those that have some idea of pleasure yokedup with them. In the interests of moral efficiency, the ideal must bethe smooth and noiseless workings of the machine, and not the rough andgrinding movements that we have come to associate with the word “duty.”For the emphasis on the negative duty we must substitute emphasis onthe positive virtue. For virtue is excellence of working, and allexcellence is pleasing. When we know what are the virtues appropriateto each age of life, we can view the moral life in a new light. Itbecomes not a claim upon us of painful obligation, but a stimulus toexcellent spontaneity and summons to self-expression.In childhood we acquire the spiritual goods that we shall take withus through life; in youth we test our acquisitions and our tools,selecting, criticizing, comparing; in old age, we put them awaygently into the attic of oblivion or retire them honorably, full ofyears and service. Our ideas, however, of what those spiritual goodswere that childhood acquired have been very much confused. We haveimagined that we could give the child “the relish of right and wrong,”as Montaigne calls it. The attempt has usually been made to train upthe child in the moral life, by telling him from his earliest yearswhat was right and what was wrong. It was supposed that in this wayhe absorbed right principles that would be the guiding springs ofhis youthful and later life. The only difficulty, of course, withthis theory is that the moral life hardly begins before the stressesand crises of youth at all. For really moral activity implies choiceand it implies significant choice; and the choices of the child arefew in number and seldom significant. You can tell a child that acertain thing is wrong, and he will believe it, but his belief will bea purely mechanical affair, an external idea, which is no more woveninto the stuff of his life than is one of those curious “post-hypnoticsuggestions,” that psychologists tell about, where the subject whilehypnotized is told to do something at a certain time after he awakes.When the time comes he does it without any consciousness of the reasonand without any immediate motive. Now most moral ideas in a child’smind are exactly similar to these suggestions. They seem to operatewith infallible accuracy, and we say,--“What a good child!” As a factthe poor child is as much under an alien spell as the subject ofthe hypnotist. Now all this sort of hypnotized morality the youngergeneration wants to have done with. It demands a morality that isglowing with self-consciousness, that is healthy with intelligence. Itrefuses to call the “good” child moral at all; it views him as a poorlittle trained animal, that is doomed for the rest of his life to gothrough mechanical motions and moral tricks at the crack of the whipof a moral code or religious authority. From home and Sunday-school,children of a slightly timid disposition get moral wounds, the scars ofwhich never heal. They enter a bondage from which they can never freethemselves; their moral judgment in youth is warped and blighted in athousand ways, and they pass through life, seemingly the most moralof men and women, but actually having never known the zest of truemorality, the relish of right and wrong. The best intentions of parentsand teachers have turned their characters into unnatural channels fromwhich they cannot break, and fixed unwittingly upon them senselessinhibitions and cautions which they find they cannot dissolve, evenwhen reason and common sense convince them that they are living underan alien code. Looked upon from this light, childish goodness andchildish conscientiousness is an unhealthy and even criminal forcingof the young plant, the hot-house bringing to maturity of a young soulwhose sole business is to grow and learn. When moral instruction isgiven, a criminal advantage is taken of the child’s suggestibility,and all possibility of an individual moral life, growing naturallyand spontaneously as the young soul meets the real emergencies andproblems that life will present to it, is lost. If, as we are comingmore and more to realize, the justification of knowledge is that ithelps us to get along with and enjoy and grapple with the world, sothe justification of virtue is that it enables us to get along withand enjoy and grapple with the spiritual world of ideals and feelingsand qualities. We should be as careful about giving a child moralideas that will be of no practical use to him as we are in giving himlearning that will be of no use to him.The virtues of childhood, then, we shall not find in the moral realm.The “good” child is not cultivated so much to-day as he was by theformer generation, whose one aim in education and religion was to bindthe young fast in the fetters of a puritan code; but he is still, inwell-brought-up families, an appalling phenomenon. The child, who atthe age of five has a fairly complete knowledge of what God wantshim and all around him to do and not to do, is an illustration ofthe results of the confusion of thought that would make childhoodinstead of youth the battle-ground of the moral life. We should notdismiss such a child as quaint, for in him have been sowed the seedsof a general obscurantism and conservatism that will spread like apalsy over his whole life. The acceptance of moral judgments thathave no vital meaning to the young soul will mean in later life theacceptance of ideas and prejudices in political and religious andsocial matters that are uncriticized and unexamined. The “good” childgrows up into the conventional bigoted man. The duties and tastes whichare inculcated into him in childhood, far from aiding the “excellentworkings of his soul,” clog and rust it, and prevent the fine freeexpression of its individuality and genius. For the child has notyet the material of experience that will enable him to get the senseof values which is at the bottom of what we call the spiritual life.And it is this sense that is so easily dulled, and that must be socarefully protected against blunting. That the child cannot formmoral judgments for himself, however, does not mean that they must beformed for him by others; it means that we must patiently wait untilhe meets the world of vivid contrasts and shocks and emergencies thatis youth. It is not repairing his lack of moral sensitiveness to gethim to repeat parrot-like the clean-cut and easily learned taboos andpermissions of the people around him. To get him to do this is exactlylike training an animal to bolt any kind of food. The child, however,has too weak a stomach to digest very much of the moral pabulum thatis fed him. The inevitable result is a moral indigestion, one form ofwhich is the once fashionable sense of sin. The youth, crammed withuncriticized taboos delivered to him with the awful prestige of anAlmighty God, at a certain age revolts, and all the healthy valuesof life turn sour within him. The cure for this spiritual dyspepsiais called conversion, but it is a question whether the cure is notoften worse than the disease. For it usually means that the relish ofright and wrong, which had suddenly become a very real thing, has beenpermanently perverted in a certain direction. By a spiritual operation,the soul has been forced to digest all this strange food, and acquiresthe ability to do so forever after. Those who do not suffer thisoperation pass through life with an uneasiness of spirit, the weightand burden of an imperfectly assimilated moral life. Few there arewho are able to throw off the whole soddenness, and if they do theyare fortunate if they are not left without any food at all. Religiousteachers have always believed that all these processes were necessaryfor the soul’s health. They have believed that it was better to havemechanical morals than no morals at all. When the younger generationsees the damage such morals work, it would prefer to have none.Discarding the “good” child, then, we will find the virtues ofchildhood in that restless, pushing, growing curiosity that is thecharacteristic of every healthy little boy or girl. The child’s life isspent in learning his way around the world; in learning the ropes ofthings, the handles and names of whatever comes within the range of hisexperience. He is busy acquiring that complex bundle of common-senseknowledge that underlies all our grown-up acts, and which has becomeso automatic with us that it hardly seems possible to us that we haveslowly acquired it all. We do not realize that thousands of facts andhabits, which have become stereotyped and practically unconscious inour minds, are the fresh and vital experiences of the mind of thelittle child. We cannot put ourselves back into that world where theabsorbing business is to give things a position and a name and tolearn all the little obvious facts about the things in the house andthe yard and the village, and in that far land of mystery beyond. Whatsort of sympathy can we have with these little people,--we, to whom allthis naïve world of place and nomenclature is so familiar as to seemintuitive? We should have to go back to a world where every passingrailroad train was a marvel and a delight, where a walk to the villagemeant casting ourselves adrift into an adventurous country whereanything was likely to happen and where all calculations of directionor return were upset. It takes children a long time to get accustomedto the world. This common workaday knowledge of ours seems intuitiveto us only because we had so many years during which it was reiteratedto us, and not because we were unusually sensitive to impressions.Children often seem almost as stupid as any young animal, and torequire long practice before they know their way around in the world,although, once obtained, this common sense is never forgotten. Thatchild is virtuous who acquires all he can of it.This curiosity of childhood makes children the first scientists. Theybegin, as soon as their eyes are open, dissolving this confused mysteryof the world, distinguishing and classifying its parts according totheir interests and needs. They push on and on, ever widening thecircle, and ever bringing more and more of their experience under thesubjugation of their understanding. They begin the process that thescientist completes. As children, after several years we came to knowour house and yard, although the attic and cellar were perhaps stilldim and fearsome places. Inside the household things were prettywell tabulated and rationalized. It was only when we went outside thegate that we might expect adventures to happen. We should have beenvery much shocked to see the fire leap from the stove and the breadfrom the table, as they did in the “Blue Bird,” but in walking downto the village we should not have been surprised to see a giant or afairy sitting on the green. When we became familiar with the village,the fairies were, of course, banished to remoter regions, until theyfinally vanished altogether. But it is not so long ago that I lost thelast vague vestige of a feeling that there were fairies in England.The facility, one might almost say skill, which children show ingetting lost, is the keynote of childhood’s world. For they have nobearings among the unfamiliar, no principles for the solution of theunknown. In their accustomed realm they are as wise and canny andfree from superstition as we are in ours. We, as grown-ups, have notacquired any magical release from fantasy. The only difference is thatwe are accustomed to make larger hazards of faith that things willrepeat themselves, and that we have a wider experience to check offour novelties by. We have charted most of our world; we unfortunatelyhave no longer any world to get lost in. To be sure, we have openedup perhaps an intangible world of philosophy and speculation, whichchildhood does not dream of, and heaven knows we can get lost there!But the thing is different. The adventure of childhood is to get losthere in this everyday world of common sense which is so familiar to us.To become really as little children we should have to get lost againhere. The best substitute we can give ourselves is to keep exploringthe new spiritual world in which we may find ourselves in youth andmiddle life, pushing out ever, as the child does, our fringe ofmystery. And we can gain the gift of wonder, something that the childdoes not have. He is too busy drinking in the facts to wonder aboutthem, or to wonder about what is beyond them. We may count ourselvesfortunate, however, that we are able to retain the child’s virtue ofcuriosity, and transmute it into the beauty of spiritual wonder.It is facts and not theories that the child is curious about, andrightly. He cannot assimilate moral theories, nor can he assimilateany other kind of theories. It is his virtue to learn how the worldruns; youth will be time enough to philosophize about that running.It is the immediate and the present that interest children, and theyare omnivorous with regard to any facts about either. What they hearabout the world they accept without question. We often think when weare telling them fairy stories or animal stories that we are exercisingtheir poetic imagination; but from their point of view we are tellingthem sober facts about the world they live in. We are often surprised,too, at the apathy they show in the midst of wonders that we point outto them. They are wonders to us because we appreciate the labor or thegenius that has produced them. In other words, we have added a valueto them. But it is just this value which the child-mind does not getand can never get. To the child they are not surprising, but simplysome more information about his world. All is grist that comes to thechild’s mill. Everything serves to plot and track for him a new realmof things as they are.The child’s mind, so suggestible to facts, seems to be almostimpervious to what we call spiritual influences. He lives in a worldhermetically sealed to our interests and concerns. Parents and teachersmake the most conscientious efforts to influence their children, butthey would better realize that they can influence them only in themost indirect way. The best thing they can do for the children is tofeed their curiosity, and provide them with all the materials that willstimulate their varied interests. They can then leave the “influence”to take care of itself. The natural child seems to be impregnable toany appeals of shame, honor, reverence, honesty, and even ridicule,--inother words, to all those methods we have devised for getting aclutch on other people’s souls, and influencing and controllingthem according to our desires. And this is not because the child isimmoral, but simply because, as I have tried to show, those socialvalues mean as yet nothing to him. He lives in a splendid isolationfrom our conventional standards; the influences of his elders, howeverwell-directed and prayerful they may be, simply do not reach him. Helives unconscious of our interests and motives. Only the “good” childis susceptible, and he is either instinctively submissive, or is thevictim of the mechanical imposition of standards and moral ideas.The child works out what little social morality he does obtain, notunder the influence of his elders, but among his playmates. And thestandards worked out there are not refined and moral at all, butrough ones of emulation and group honor, and respect for prowess. Evenobedience, which we all like to think of as one of the indispensableaccomplishments of a well-trained child, seems to be obtained at thecost of real moral growth. It might be more beneficial if it were nottoo often merely a means for the spiritual edification of the parentsthemselves. Too often it is the delight of ruling, of being madeobeisance to, that is the secret motive of imposing strict obedience,and not our desire simply that they shall learn the excellent habitsthat are our own. One difficulty with the child who has “learned tomind” is that, if he learns too successfully, he runs the risk ofgrowing up to be a cowardly and servile youth. There is a theory thatsince the child will be obliged in later life to do many things thathe does not want to do, he might as well learn how while he is young.The difficulty here seems to be that learning to do one kind of athing that you do not want to do does not guarantee your readiness todo other kinds of unpleasant things. That art cannot be taught. Eachsituation of compulsion, unless the spirit is completely broken, willhave its own peculiar quality of bitterness, and no guarantee againstit can be inculcated. Life will present so many inevitable necessitiesto the child when he gets out into the world that it seems premature toburden his childhood with a training which will be largely useless. Somuch of our energy is wasted, and so much friction created, because weare unwilling to trust life. If life is the great demoralizer, it isalso the great moralizer. It whips us into shape, and saddles us withresponsibilities and the means of meeting them, with obligations andthe will to meet them, with burdens and a strength to bear them. Itcreates in us a conscience and the love of duty, and endows us with amorality that a mother and father with the power and the love of angelsworking through all the years of our childhood could not have createdwithin us. Trust life and not your own feeble efforts to create thesoul in the child!The virtue of childhood, then, is an exhaustless curiosity and interestin the world in which the child finds himself. He is here to learn hisway around in it, to learn the names of things and their uses, howto use his body and his capacities. This will be the most excellentworking of his soul. If his mind and body are active, he will be a“good” child, in the best sense of the word. We can almost afford tolet him be insolent and irreverent and troublesome as long as he isonly curious. If he has a temper, it will not be cured by curbing, butby either letting it burn out, or not giving it fuel to feed on. Foodfor his body and facts for his mind are the sustenance he requires.From the food will be built up his body, and from the facts and hisreactions to them will slowly evolve his world of values and ideals. Wecannot aid him by giving him our theories, or shorten the path for himby presenting him with ready-made standards. In spite of all the moralteachers, there is no short cut to the moral life of youth, any morethan there is a royal road to knowledge. Nor can we help him to growby transferring some of our superfluous moral flesh to his bones. Thechild’s qualities which shock our sense of propriety are evidences notof his immorality, but of his pre-morality. A morality that will meananything to him can only be built up out of a vast store of experience,and only when his world has broadened out into a real society withinfluences of every kind coming from every side. He cannot get therelish of right and wrong until he has tasted life, and it is thetaste of life that the child does not have. That taste comes only withyouth, and then with a bewildering complexity and vividness.But between childhood and youth there comes a trying period when thechild has become well cognizant of the practical world, but has as yetno hint of the gorgeous colors of youth. At thirteen, for instance, onehas the world pretty well charted, but not yet has the slow chemistryof time transmuted this experience into meanings and values. There isa crassness and materiality about the following three or four yearsthat have no counterpart until youth is over and the sleek years of theforties have begun. How cocksure and familiar with the world is the boyor girl at this age! They have no doubts, but they have no glow. At notime in life is one so unspiritual, so merely animal, so much of theearth, earthy. How different is it to be a few years later! How shakenand adventurous will the world appear then! For this waiting periodof life, the virtues are harder to discover. Curiosity has lapsed,for there do not seem to be many things left to be curious about. Thechild is beautifully unconscious of his own ignorance. Similarly hasthe play activity diminished; the boy has put away his Indian costumes,and the girl her dolls. At this season of life the virtue would seemto consist in the acquirement of some skill in some art or handicraftor technique. This is the time to search for the budding talents andthe strong native bents and inclinations. To be interesting is one ofthe best of virtues, and few things make a person more interesting thanskill or talent. From a selfish point of view, too, all who have grownup with unskillful hands will realize the solid virtue of knowing howto do something with the hands, and avoid that vague restlessness anddesire to get at grips with something that haunts the professionalman who has neglected in youth to cultivate this virtue of technique.And it is a virtue which, if not acquired at that time, can never beacquired. The deftness of hand, alertness of mind, are soon lost ifthey are not taken advantage of, and the child grows up helpless andunskillful, with a restless void where a talent and interest should be.It is with youth, then, that the moral life begins, the true relish ofright and wrong. Out of the crucible of passion and enthusiasm emergethe virtues of life, virtues that will have been tested and tried inthe furnace of youth’s poignant reactions to the world of possibilitiesand ideals that has been suddenly opened up to it. Those young peoplewho have been the victims of childish morality will not feel this newworld so clearly or keenly, or, if there did lurk underneath the crustof imposed priggishness some latent touch of genius, they will feelthe new life with a terrible searing pain that maddens them and maypermanently distort their whole vision of life. To those without thespark, the new life will come stained by prejudice. Their reactionswill be dulled; they will not see clearly; and will either stagger atthe shock, or go stupidly ahead oblivious of the spiritual wonderson every side. Only those who have been allowed to grow freely likeyoung plants, with the sun and air above their heads, will get thefull beauty and benefit of youth. Only those whose eyes have been keptwide open ceaselessly learning the facts of the material and practicalworld will truly appreciate the values of the moral world, and be ableto acquire virtue. Only with this fund of practical knowledge willthe youth be able to balance and contrast and compare the bits of hisexperience, see them in the light of their total meaning, and learn toprefer rightly one bit to another. It is as if silent forces had beenat work in the soul during the last years of childhood, organizing theknowledge and nascent sentiments of the child into forms of power readyfor the free expression of youth.Youth expresses itself by falling in love. Whether it be art, a girl,socialism, religion, the sentiment is the same; the youth is sweptaway by a flood of love. He has learned to value, and how superlativeand magnificent are his values! The little child hardly seems to love;indeed, his indifference to grown people, even to his own parents,is often amazing. He has the simple affection of a young animal, buthow different his cool regard from the passionate flame of youth!Love is youth’s virtue, and it is wide as well as deep. There is notragic antithesis between a youth’s devotion to a cause and his lovefor a girl. They are not mutually exclusive, as romanticists oftenlove to think, but beautifully compatible. They tend to fuse, and theystimulate and ennoble each other. The first love of youth for anythingis pure and ethereal and disinterested. It is only when thwarted thatlove turns sensual, only when mocked that enthusiasm becomes fanaticalor mercenary. Worldly opinion seems to care much more for personallove than for the love of ideals. Perhaps it is instinctively moreinterested in the perpetuation of the race than in its progress. Itgives its suffrage and approval to the love of a youth for a girl, butit mocks and discredits the enthusiast. It just grudgingly permitsthe artist to live, but it piles almost insurmountable obstacles inthe path of the young radical. The course of true love may never runsmooth, but what of the course of true idealism?The springs that feed this love are found, of course, in hero-worship.Sexual love is objectified in some charming and appealing girl, lovefor ideals in some teacher or seer or the inspiring personality ofa friend. It is in youth that we can speak of real influence. Thenis the soul responsive to currents and ideas. The embargo which keptthe child’s mind immune to theory and opinion and tastes is suddenlylifted. In childhood, our imitation is confined to the external; wecopy ways of acting, but we are insensitive to the finer nuances ofpersonality. But in youth we become sensitive to every passing toneand voice. Youth is the season when, through this sensitiveness, thedeadly pressures get their purchase on the soul; it is also the seasonfor the most momentous and potent influences for good. In youth, ifthere is the possibility that the soul be permanently warped out ofshape, there is also the possibility that it receive the nourishmentthat enables it to develop its own robust beauty. It is by hero-worshipthat we copy not the externals of personality, as in childhood, butthe inner spirit. We feel ourselves somehow merged with the admiredpersons, and we draw from them a new stimulating grace. We findourselves in them. It is not yielding to a pressure that would force usto a type, but a drawing up of ourselves to a higher level, through theaid of one who possesses all those qualities which have been all along,we feel, our vague and hitherto unexpressed ideal. We do not feel thatour individualities are being lost, but that they are for the firsttime being found. We have discovered in another personality all thosebest things for which our hearts have been hungering, and we are simplyhelping ourselves to that which is in reality our own. Our hero givesof himself inexhaustibly, and we take freely and gladly what we need.It is thus that we stock up with our first store of spiritual values.It is from the treasury of a great and good personality that we receivethe first confirmation of ourselves. In the hero-personality, we seeour own dim, baby ideals objectified. Their splendor encourages us,and nerves us for the struggle to make them thoroughly our own.There is a certain pathos in the fact that parents are so seldomthe heroes from whom the children derive this revelation of theirown personality. It is more often some teacher or older friend oreven a poet or reformer whom the youth has never seen and knows onlythrough his words and writings. But for this the parents are partlyresponsible. They are sufficiently careful about the influences whichplay upon their young children. They give care and prayers and tearsto their bringing-up in the years when the children are almost immuneto any except the more obvious mechanical influences, and learn ofideals and values only in a parrot-like fashion. But when the childapproaches youth, the parent is apt to relax vigilance and, with a cryof thanksgiving and self-congratulation that the child has been broughtsafely through so many perils to the desired haven, to surrender himto his own devices. Just at the time when he becomes really sensitivefor the first time to spiritual influences, he is deprived of thisclosest and warmest influence of the home. But he has not been broughtinto a haven, but launched into a heaving and troubled sea. This isthe time when his character lies at stake, and the possibility of hisbeing a radical, individual force in the world hangs in the balance.Whether he will become this force depends on the pressures that he isable to dodge, and on the positive ideals he is able to secure. Andthey will depend largely on the heroes he worships, upon his findingthe personalities that seem to contain all the best for which heyearns. Hero-worship is the best preservative against cheapness ofsoul, that besetting sin of modern youth. It directs our attention awayfrom the light and frothy things of the world, which are wont to claimso much of youth’s interest, to qualities that are richer and moresatisfying. Yet hero-worship is no mere imitation. We do not simplyadopt new qualities and a new character. We rather impregnate ourhitherto sterile ideals with the creative power of a tested and assuredpersonality, and give birth to a new reliance and a new faith. Ourheroes anticipate and provide for our doubts and fears, and fortify usagainst the sternest assaults of the world. We love our heroes becausethey have first loved us.Out of this virtue of love and the clashing of its clear spirit withthe hard matter of established things come the sterner virtues. Fromthat conflict, courage is struck off as youth feels the need ofkeeping his flame steady and holding to his own course, regardlessof obstacles or consequences. Youth needs courage, that salt ofthe virtues, for if youth has its false hopes, it has its falsedepressions. That strange melancholy, when things seem to lose theirsubstance and the world becomes an empty shell, is the reverse shieldof the elation of youth. To face and overcome it is a real test of thecourage of youth. The dash and audacity, the daring and self-confidenceof youth, are less fine than this simple courage of optimism. Youthneeds courage, too, when its desires do not come true, when it meetssuspicion or neglect, and when its growth seems inexorably checked bycircumstance. In these emergencies, the youth usually plays the stoic.He feels a savage pride in the thought that circumstance can never robhim of his integrity, or bring his best self to be dependent on merechange of fortune. Such a courage is a guarantor of youth. It forms aprotecting crust over life and lessens the shock of many contingencies.The only danger is that it may become too perfect a shell and hardenthe character. It is not well for youth to shun the battle. Couragedemands exposure to assault.And besides courage, youth needs temperance. The sins and excessesof hot-blooded youth are a byword; youth would not seem to be youthwithout its carnality and extravagance. It is fortunate that youth isable to expend that extravagance partly in idealism. Love is alwaysthe antidote to sensuality. And we can always, if we set ourselvesresolutely to the task, transmute the lower values into higher.This, indeed, is the crucial virtue of youth, and temperance is theseal and evidence of the transmutation. Temperance in things of theflesh is ordained not through sentimental reasons, but on the best ofphysiological and psychological motives. Temperance is a virtue becauseof the evil consequences to one’s self and others which follow excessof indulgence in appetite.But this temperance does not mean quite the same thing as the rigidself-control that used to be preached. The new morality has a morepositive ideal than the rigid mastery which self-control implies. Weare to fix our attention more in giving our good impulses full playthan in checking the bad. The theory is that if one is occupied withhealthy ideas and activities, there will be no room or time for theexpression of the unhealthy ones. Anything that implies an inhibitionor struggle to repress is a draining away into a negative channel ofenergy that might make for positive constructive work in the character.The repressed desires and interests are not killed, but merely checked,and they persist, with unabated vigor, in struggling to get the upperhand again. They are little weakened by lying dormant, and lurk warilybelow, ready to swarm up again on deck, whenever there is the smallestlapse of vigilance. But if they are neglected they gradually cease fromtroubling, and are killed by oblivion where they could not have beenhurt by forcible repression. The mortification of the flesh seems toooften simply to strengthen its pride.In the realm of emotion, the dangers of rigid self-control areparticularly evident. There are fashions in emotion as well as indress, and it seems to have become the fashion in certain circlesof youth to inhibit any emotional expression of the sincere orthe serious. There is a sort of reign of terrorism which preventspersonal conversation from being carried on upon any plane except oneof flippancy and insincerity. Frankness of expression in regard topersonal feelings and likes and dislikes is tabooed. A strange newethics of tact has grown up which makes candor so sacrilegious athing that its appearance in a group or between two young people ofthe opposite sex creates general havoc and consternation. Young peoplewho dare to give natural expression to their feelings about each otheror about their ideals and outlook on life find themselves genuinelyunpopular. When this peculiar ethics works at its worst, it gives aperson a pride in concealing his or her feelings on any of the vitaland sincere aspects of life, the interests and admirations and tastes.But this energy, dammed up thus from expression in its natural way,overflows in a hysterical admiration for the trivial, and an unhealthyinterest in the mere externals, the “safe” things, of life. Suchself-control dwarfs the spirit; it results only in misunderstandingsand a tragic ignorance of life. It is one of the realest of the vicesof youth, for it is the parent of a host of minor ailments of thesoul. It seems to do little good even to repress hatred and malice.If repressed, they keep knocking at the door of consciousness, andpoison the virtues that might develop if the soul could only get rid ofits load of spleen. If the character is thickly sown with impersonalinterests and the positive virtues are carefully cultivated, there willbe no opportunity for these hateful weeds to reach the sun and air.Virtue should actually crowd out vice, and temperance is the tool thatyouth finds ready to its hand. Temperance means the happy harmonizingand coördinating of the expression of one’s personality; it meanshealth, candor, sincerity, and wisdom,--knowledge of one’s self and thesympathetic understanding of comrades.Justice is a virtue which, if it be not developed in youth, has littlechance of ever being developed. It depends on a peculiarly sensitivereaction to good and evil, and it is only in youth that those reactionsare keen and disinterested. Real justice is always a sign of greatinnocence; it cannot exist side by side with interested motives or atrace of self-seeking. And a sense of justice is hard to develop inthis great industrial world where the relations of men are so out ofjoint and where such flaunting anomalies assail one at every turn. Yetin the midst of it all youth is still pure of heart, and it is onlythe pure of heart who can be just. For in youth we live in a worldof clean disinterestedness. We have ambitions and desires, but notyet have we learned the devious way by which they may be realized.We have not learned how to achieve our ends by taking advantage ofother people, and using them and their interests and necessities asmeans. We still believe in the possibility of every man’s realizinghimself side by side with us. In early youth, therefore, we have aninstinctive and almost unconscious sense of justice. Not yet havewe learned the trick of exploiting our fellow men. If we are earlyassailed with the reality of social disorder, and have brought hometo our hearts the maladjustments of our present order, that sense ofjustice is transformed into a passion. This passion for social justiceis one of the most splendid of the ideals of youth. It has the power ofkeeping alive all the other virtues; it stimulates life and gives it anew meaning and tone. It furnishes the _leit-motiv_ which is so sadlylacking in many lives. And youth must find a _leit-motiv_ of some kind,or its spirit perishes. This social idealism acts like a tonic uponthe whole life; it keeps youth alive even after one has grown older inyears.With justice comes the virtue of democracy. We learn all too earlyin youth the undemocratic way of thinking, the divisions anddiscriminations which the society around us makes among people. Butyouth cannot be swept by love or fired by the passion for justicewithout feeling a wild disgust at everything that suggests artificialinequalities and distinctions. Democracy means a belief that peopleare worthy; it means trust in the good faith and the dignity of theaverage man. The chief reason why the average man is not now worthyof more trust, the democrat believes, is simply that he has not beentrusted enough in the past. Democracy has little use for philanthropy,at least in the sense of a kindly caring for people, with the constantrecognition that the person who is kind is superior to the personwho is being done good to. The spirit of democracy is a much morerobust humanity. It is rough and aggressive; it stands people up ontheir own feet, makes them take up their beds and walk. It prods themto move their own limbs and take care of themselves. It makes themstrong by giving them something to do. It will have nothing more to dowith the superstition of trusteeship which paralyzes now most of ourinstitutional life. It does not believe for a minute that everybodyneeds guardians for most of the serious concerns of life. The greatcrime of the past has been that humankind has never been willing totrust itself, or men each other. We have tied ourselves up with lawsand traditions, and devised a thousand ways to prevent men from beingthrown on their own responsibility and cultivating their own powers.Our society has been constituted on the principle that men must besaved from themselves. We have surrounded ourselves with so many moralhedges, have imposed upon ourselves so many checks and balances, thatlife has been smothered. Our liberation has just begun. We are far fromfree, but the new spirit of democracy is the angel that will free us.No virtue is more potent for youth.And the last of these virtues, redolent of the old Greek time,when men walked boldly, when the world was still young, and godsand nymphs not all dead, is wisdom. To be wise is simply to haveblended and harmonized one’s experience, to have fused it togetherinto a “philosophy of life.” Wisdom is a matter not of quantity,but of quality of experience. It means getting at the heart of it,and obtaining the same clear warm impression of its meaning thatthe artist does of the æsthetic idea that he is going to represent.Wisdom in youth or early middle life may be far truer than in laterlife. One’s courage may weaken under repeated failure, one’s sense ofjustice be dulled by contact with the wrong relations between men andclasses, one’s belief in democracy destroyed by the seeming failure ofexperiments. But this gathering cynicism does not mean the acquiringof wisdom, but the losing of it. The usefulness and practicability ofthese virtues of youth are not really vitiated by the struggles theyhave in carrying themselves through into practice; what is exhibitedis merely the toughness of the old forces of prejudice and tradition,and the “pig-headedness” of the old philosophy of timorousness anddistrust. True wisdom is faith in love, in justice, in democracy; youthhas this faith in largest measure; therefore youth is most wise.Middle age steals upon a youth almost before he is aware. He willrecognize it at first, perhaps, by a slight paling of his enthusiasms,or by a sudden consciousness that his early interests have beensubmerged in the flood of routine work and family cares. The lateryears of youth and the early years of middle life are in truth thedangerous age, for then may be lost the virtues that were acquired inyouth. Or, if not lost, many will be felt to be superfluous. There isdanger that the peculiar bias of the relish of right and wrong thatthe virtues of youth have given one may be weakened, and the soulspread itself too thin over life. Now one of the chief virtues ofmiddle life is to conserve the values of youth, to practice in soberearnest the virtues that came so naturally in the enthusiasm of youth,but which take on a different hue when exposed to what seem to be thecrass facts of the workaday world. But there is no reason why work,ambition, the raising of a family, should dull the essential spiritof youthful idealism. It may not be so irrepressible, so freakish, sointolerant, but it should not be different in quality and significance.The burdens of middle life are not a warrant for the releasing of thespiritual obligations of youth. They do not give one the right to lookback with amused regret to the dear follies of the past. For as soonas the spirit of youth begins to leave the soul, that soul begins todie. Middle-aged people are too much inclined to speak of youth as asort of spiritual play. They forget that youth feels that it itself hasthe serious business of life, the real crises to meet. To youth it ismiddle age that seems trivial and playful. It is after the serious workof love-making and establishing one’s self in economic independenceis over that one can rest and play. Youth has little time for thatsort of recreation. In middle age, most of the problems have beensolved, the obstacles overcome. There is a slackening of the lines,a satisfied taking of one’s reward. And to youth this must alwaysseem a tragedy, that the season of life when the powers are at theirhighest should be the season when they are oftener turned to materialthan to spiritual ends. Youth has the energy and ideals, but not thevantage-ground of prestige from which to fight for them. Middle age hasthe prestige and the power, but too seldom the will to use it for thefurtherance of its ideals. Youth has the isolation, the independence,the disinterestedness so that it may attack any foe, but it has notthe reserve force to carry that attack through. Middle age has all thereserve power necessary, but is handicapped by family obligations, bybusiness and political ties, so that its power is rarely effective forsocial or individual progress.The supreme virtue of middle age will be, then, to make this difficultfusion,--to combine devotion to one’s family, to one’s chosen work,with devotion to the finer idealism and impersonal aims that formedone’s philosophy of youth. To keep alive through all the twistingsand turnings of life’s road the sense of a larger humanity that needsspiritual and material succor, of the individual spiritual life ofideal interests, is a task of virtue that will tax the resources ofany man or woman. Yet here lies the true virtue of middle age,--to useits splendid powers to enhance the social and individual life roundone, to radiate influence that transforms and elevates. The secretof such a radiant personality seems to be that one, while minglingfreely in the stress of everyday life, sees all its details in thelight of larger principles, against the background of their socialmeaning. In other words, it is a virtue of middle life to be sociallyself-conscious. And this spirit is the best protector against theravages of the tough material world. Only by this social consciousnesscan that toughness be softened. The image of the world the way it oughtto be must never be lost sight of in the picture of the world the wayit is.This conservation of the spirit is even more necessary for the womanthan for the man. The active life of the latter makes it fairlycertain that he, while he may become hard and callous, will at leastretain some sort of grip on the world’s bigger movements. There isno such certainty for the mother. Indeed, she seems often to take areal pleasure in voluntarily offering up in sacrifice at the time ofmarriage what few ideal interests and tastes she has. The spectacleof the young mother devoting all her time and strength to her childrenand husband, and surrendering all other interests to the interests ofthe home, is usually considered inspiring and attractive, especially bythe men. Not so attractive is she thirty years later, when, her familycares having lapsed and her children scattered, she is left high anddry in the world. If she then takes a well-earned rest, it seems apity that that rest should be so generally futile and uninteresting.Without interests and tastes, and with no longer any useful function insociety, she is relegated to the most trivial amusements and pursuits.Idle and vapid, she finds nothing to do but fritter away her time. Theresult is a really appalling waste of economic and social energy inmiddle age. Now it is the virtue of this season of life to avoid allthis. The woman as well as the man must realize that her home is notbounded by the walls of the house, that it has wider implications,leading out into all the interests of the community and the state. Thatwomen of this age have not yet learned to be good mothers and goodcitizens at the same time, does not show that it is impossible, butthat it is a virtue that requires more resolution than our moralityhas been willing to exhibit. The relish of right and wrong must be arelish of social right and wrong as well as of individual.As middle age passes on into old age, however, one earns a certainright of relaxation. If there is no right to let go the sympathyfor the virtues of youth and the conservation of its spirit, therecomes the right to give over some of the aggressive activity. Toyouth belongs the practical action. At no other age is there the sameimpulse and daring. The virtue of later middle age is to encourageand support, rather than actively engage. It is true we have neverlearned this lesson. We still surrender to semi-old men the authorityto govern us, think for us, act for us. We endow them with spiritualas well as practical leadership, and allow them to strip youth ofits opportunities and powers. We permit them to rule not only theirown but all the generations. If we could be sure that their rulemeant progress, we could trust them to guide us. But, in these timesat least, it seems to mean nothing so much as a last fight for adiscredited undemocratic philosophy that modern youth are completelythrough with. From this point of view one of the virtues of this middleseason of life will be the imaginative understanding of youth’spurposes and radical ideals. At that age, one no longer needs the samecourage to face the battles of life; they are already most of themirrevocably won or lost. There is not the same claim of temperance; thepassions and ambitions are relaxed. The sense of justice and democracywill have become a habit or else they will have been forever lost. Onlythe need of wisdom remains,--that unworldly wisdom which mellowingyears can bring, which sees through the disturbance and failure of lifethe truth and efficacy of youth’s ideal vision.Old age is such a triumph that it may almost be justly relieved of anyburden of virtues or duties; it is so unique and beautiful that theold should be given the perfect freedom of the moral city. So splendida victory is old age over the malign forces of disease and weaknessand death that one is tempted to say that its virtue lies simply inbeing old. Those virtues of youth which grew out of the crises andtemptations, physical and spiritual, of early life, are no longerrelevant. There may come instead the quieter virtues of contentmentand renunciation. Old people have few crises and few temptations; theylive in the past and not in the future, as youth does. They cannotbe required, therefore, to have that scorn for tradition which is thevirtue of youth. They can keep alive for us the tradition that _is_vital, and from them we can learn many things.The value of their experience to us is not that it teaches us to avoidtheir mistakes, for we must try all things for ourselves. The oldergeneration, it is true, often flatters itself that its mistakes somehowmake for our benefit, because we learn from their errors to avoidthe pitfalls into which they came. But there is no making mistakesby the proxy of a former generation. The world has moved on in themean time; the pitfalls are new, and we shall only entangle ourselvesthe more by adopting the methods of our ancestors in getting out ofthe difficulties. But the value of an old man’s experience is thathe has preserved in it the living tradition and hands down to us oldhonesties, old sincerities, and old graces, that have been crushed inthe rough-and-tumble of modern life. It is not tradition in itselfthat is dangerous, but only dead tradition that has no meaning for thepresent and is a mere weight on our progress. Such is the legal andeconomic tradition given to us by our raucous, middle-aged leaders ofopinion, adopted by them through motives of present gain, and notthrough sincere love of the past.But old men, looking back over the times in which they have lived,throw a poetic glamour over the past and make it live again. They seeit idealized, but it is the _real_ that they see idealized. An old manof personality and charm has the faculty of cutting away from the pastthe dead wood, and preserving for us the living tissue which we cangraft profitably on our own growing present. Old men have much of thedisinterestedness of youth; they have no ulterior motive in giving usthe philosophy of their past. The wisest of them instinctively selectwhat is vital for our present nourishment. It is not old men that youthhas to fear, but the semi-old, who have lost touch with their youth,and have not lived long enough to get the disinterested vision of theiridealized past. But old men who have lived this life of radical virtueare the best of teachers; they distill the perfume of the past, andbring it to us to sweeten our present. Such men grow old only in body.The radical spirit of youth has the power of abolishing considerationsof age; the body changes, but the spirit remains the same. In thissense, it is the virtue of old age not to become old.The besetting sin of this season of life is apathy. Old age should notbe a mere waiting for death. The fact that we cannot reconcile deathwith life shows that they ought not to be discussed in the same terms.They belong to two different orders. Death has no part in life, and inlife there can be no such thing as preparation for death. An old manlives to his appointed time, and then his life ends; but the life up tothat ending, barring the loss of his faculties, has been all life andnot a whit death. Old men do not fear death as much as do young men,and this calmness is not so much a result of disillusionment with lifeas a recognition that their life has been lived, their work finished,the cycle of their activity rounded off. One virtue of old age, then,is to live as fully at the height of one’s powers as strength willpermit, passing out of life serene and unreluctant, with willingness tolive and yet with willingness to die. To know an old man who has grownold slowly, taking the seasons as they came, conserving the spirit ofhis youthful virtues, mellowing his philosophy of life, acquiring aclearer, saner, and more beautiful outlook on human nature and all itsspiritual values with each passing year, is an education in the virtuesof life. The virtues which produce an old age such as this do not cutacross the grain of life, but enhance and conserve the vital impulsesand forces. Such an old age is the crowning evidence of the excellentworking of the soul. A life needs no other proof than this that eachseason has known its proper virtue and healthful activity.IVTHE LIFE OF IRONYI could never, until recently, divest myself of the haunting feelingthat being ironical had something to do with the entering of the ironinto one’s soul. I thought I knew what irony was, and I admired itimmensely. I could not believe that there was something metallic andbitter about it. Yet this sinister connotation of a clanging, raspingmeanness of spirit, which I am sure it has still in many people’sminds, clung about it, until one happy day my dictionary told me thatthe iron had never entered into the soul at all, but the soul intothe iron (St. Jerome had read the psalm wrong), and that irony wasGreek, with all the free, happy play of the Greek spirit about it,letting in fresh air and light into others’ minds and our own. Itwas to the Greek an incomparable method of intercourse, the rub ofmind against mind by the simple use of simulated ignorance and theadoption, without committing one’s self, of another’s point of view.Not until I read the Socrates of Plato did I fully appreciate thatthis irony,--this pleasant challenging of the world, this insistentjudging of experience, this sense of vivid contrasts and incongruities,of comic juxtapositions, of flaring brilliancies, and no lessheartbreaking impossibilities, of all the little parts of one’s worldbeing constantly set off against each other, and made intelligible onlyby being translated into and defined in each others’ terms,--that thiswas a life, and a life of beauty, that one might suddenly discoverone’s self living all unawares. And if one could judge one’s own feeblereflection, it was a life that had no room for iron within its soul.We should speak not of the Socratic method but of the Socratic life.For irony is a life rather than a method. A life cannot be takenoff and put on again at will; a method can. To be sure, some peopletalk of life exactly as if it were some portable commodity, or someexchangeable garment. We must live, they cry, as if we were about tobegin. And perhaps they are. Only some of us would rather die than livethat puny life that they can adopt and cover themselves with. Irony istoo rich and precious a thing to be capable of such transmission. Theironist is born and not made. This critical attitude towards life, thisdelicious sense of contrasts that we call irony, is not a pose or anamusement. It is something that colors every idea and every feeling ofthe man who is so happy as to be endowed with it.Most people will tell you, I suppose, that the religious convictionof salvation is the only permanently satisfying coloring of life. Inthe splendid ironists, however, one sees a sweeter, more flexible andhuman principle of life, adequate, without the buttress of supernaturalbelief, to nourish and fortify the spirit. In the classic ironist ofall time, irony shows an inherent nobility, a nobility that all ageshave compared favorably with the Christian ideal. Lacking the spur ofreligious emotion, the sweetness of irony may be more difficult tomaintain than the mood of belief. But may it not for that very reasonbe judged superior, for is it not written, He that endureth unto theend shall be saved?It is not easy to explain the quality of that richest and mostsatisfying background of life. It lies, I think, in a vivid and intensefeeling of aliveness which it gives. Experience comes to the ironist inlittle darts or spurts, with the added sense of contrast. Most men, Iam afraid, see each bit of personal experience as a unit, strung moreor less loosely on a string of other mildly related bits. But theman with the ironical temperament is forced constantly to compare andcontrast his experience with what was, or what might be, or with whatought to be, and it is the shocks of these comparisons and contraststhat make up his inner life. He thinks he leads a richer life, becausehe feels not only the individual bits but the contrasts besides in alltheir various shadings and tints. To this sense of impingement of factsupon life is due a large part of this vividness of irony; and the restis due to the alertness of the ironical mind. The ironist is alwayscritically awake. He is always judging, and watching with inexhaustibleinterest, in order that he may judge. Now irony in its best sense is anexquisite sense of proportion, a sort of spiritual tact in judging thevalues and significances of experience. This sense of being spirituallyalive which ceaseless criticism of the world we live in gives us,combined with the sense of power which free and untrammeled judgingproduces in us, is the background of irony. And it should be a means tothe truest goodness.Socrates made one mistake,--knowledge is not goodness. But it is a steptowards judging, and good judgment is the true goodness. For it is onjudgment impelled by desire that we act. The clearer and cleaner ourjudgments then, the more definite and correlated our actions. And thegreat value of these judgments of irony is that they are not artificialbut spring naturally out of life. Irony, the science of comparativeexperience, compares things not with an established standard but witheach other, and the values that slowly emerge from the process, valuesthat emerge from one’s own vivid reactions, are constantly revised,corrected, and refined by that same sense of contrast. The ironiclife is a life keenly alert, keenly sensitive, reacting promptly withfeelings of liking or dislike to each bit of experience, letting noneof it pass without interpretation and assimilation, a life full andsatisfying,--indeed a rival of the religious life.The life of irony has the virtues of the religious life without itsdefects. It expresses the aggressive virtues without the quiescence ofresignation. For the ironist has the courageous spirit, the sympatheticheart and the understanding mind, and can give them full play,unhampered by the searching introspection of the religious mind thatoften weakens rather than ennobles and fortifies. He is at one with thereligious man in that he hates apathy and stagnation, for they meandeath. But he is superior in that he attacks apathy of intellect andpersonality as well as apathy of emotion. He has a great convictionof the significance of all life, the lack of which conviction is themost saddening feature of the religious temperament. The religiousman pretends that every aspect of life has meaning for him, but inpractice he constantly minimizes the noisier and vivider elements. Heis essentially an aristocrat in his interpretation of values, while theironist is incorrigibly a democrat. Religion gives a man an intimacywith a few selected and rarified virtues and moods, while irony makeshim a friend of the poor and lowly among spiritual things. When thereligious man is healing and helping, it is at the expense of hisspiritual comfort; he must tear himself away from his companions and goout grimly and sacrificingly into the struggle. The ironist, living hisdays among the humbler things, feels no such severe call to service.And yet the ironist, since he has no citadel of truth to defend, isreally the more adventurous. Life, not fixed in predestined formulas ormeasurable by fixed, immutable standards, is fluid, rich and exciting.To the ironist it is both discovery and creation. His courage seeksout the obscure places of human personality, and his sympathy andunderstanding create new interests and enthusiasms in the other mindsupon which they play. And these new interests in turn react upon hisown life, discovering unexpected vistas there, and creating new insightinto the world that he lives in. That democratic, sympathetic outlookupon the feelings and thoughts and actions of men and women is the lifeof irony.That life is expressed in the social intercourse of ourselves withothers. The daily fabric of the life of irony is woven out of ourcritical communings with ourselves and the personalities of our friend,and the people with whom we come in contact. The ironist, by adoptinganother’s point of view and making it his own in order to carry lightand air into it, literally puts himself in the other man’s place.Irony is thus the truest sympathy. It is no cheap way of ridiculing anopponent by putting on his clothes and making fun of him. The ironisthas no opponent, but only a friend. And in his irony he is helping thatfriend to reveal himself. That half-seriousness, that solemn treatmentof the trivial and trivial treatment of the solemn which is the patternof the ironist’s talk is but his way of exhibiting the unexpectedcontrasts and shadings that he sees to be requisite to the keenestunderstanding of the situation. The ironist borrows and exchangesand appropriates ideas and gives them a new setting in juxtapositionwith others, but he never burlesques or caricatures or exaggeratesthem. If an idea is absurd, the slightest change of environment willshow that absurdity. The mere transference of an idea to another’smouth will bring to light all its hidden meaninglessness. It needs noextraneous aid. If an idea is hollow, it will show itself coweringagainst the intellectual background of the ironist like the puny,shivering thing it is. If a point of view cannot bear being adoptedby another person, if it is not hardy enough to be transplanted, ithas little right to exist at all. This world is no hothouse for ideasand attitudes. Too many outworn ideas are skulking in dark retreats,sequestered from the light; every man has great sunless stretches inhis soul where base prejudices lurk and flourish. On these the whitelight of irony is needed to play. And it delights the ironist to watchthem shrivel and decay under that light. The little tabooed regions ofwell-bred people, the “things we never mention,” the basic biases andassumptions that underlie the lives and thinking of every class andprofession, our second-hand dogmas and phrases,--all these live andthrive because they have never been transplanted, or heard from thelips of another. The dictum that “the only requisites for success arehonesty and merit,” which we applaud so frantically from the lips ofthe successful, becomes a ghastly irony in the mouth of an unemployedworkingman. There would be a frightful mortality of points of viewcould we have a perfectly free exchange such as this. Irony is justthis temporary borrowing and lending. Many of our cherished idealswould lose half their validity were they put bodily into the mouthsof the less fortunate. But if irony destroys some ideals it builds upothers. It tests ideals by their social validity, by their generalinterchangeability among all sorts of people and the world, but if itleaves the foundations of many in a shaky condition and renders moresimply provisional, those that it does leave standing are imperishablyfounded in the common democratic experience of all men.To the ironist it seems that the irony is not in the speaking but inthe things themselves. He is a poor ironist who would consciouslydistort, or attempt to make another’s idea appear in any light exceptits own. Absurdity is an intrinsic quality of so many things that theyonly have to be touched to reveal it. The deadliest way to annihilatethe unoriginal and the insincere is to let it speak for itself. Ironyis this letting things speak for themselves and hang themselves bytheir own rope. Only, it repeats the words after the speaker, andadjusts the rope. It is the commanding touch of a comprehendingpersonality that dissolves the seemingly tough husk of the idea.The ironical method might be compared to the acid that develops aphotographic plate. It does not distort the image, but merely bringsclearly to the light all that was implicit in the plate before. Andif it brings the picture to the light with values reversed, so doesirony revel in a paradox, which is simply a photographic negative ofthe truth, truth with the values reversed. But turn the negative everso slightly so that the light falls upon it, and the perfect pictureappears in all its true values and beauty. Irony, we may say then, isthe photography of the soul. The picture goes through certain changesin the hands of the ironist, but without these changes the truth wouldbe simply a blank, unmeaning surface. The photograph is a synonym fordeadly accuracy. Similarly the ironist insists always on seeing thingsas they are. He is a realist, whom the grim satisfaction of seeing thetruth compensates for any sordidness that it may bring along with it.Things as they are, thrown against the background of things as theyought to be,--this is the ironist’s vision. I should like to feel thatthe vision of the religious man is not too often things as they are,thrown against the background of things as they ought not to be.The ironist is the only man who makes any serious attempt todistinguish between fresh and second-hand experience. Our minds are sounfortunately arranged that all sorts of beliefs can be accepted andpropagated quite independently of any rational or even experimentalbasis at all. Nature does not seem to care very much whether our ideasare true or not, as long as we get on through life safely enough.And it is surprising on what an enormous amount of error we can getalong comfortably. We cannot be wrong on every point or we shouldcease to live, but so long as we are empirically right in our habits,the truth or falsity of our ideas seems to have little effect uponour comfort. We are born into a world that is an inexhaustible storeof ready-made ideas, stored up in tradition, in books, and in everymedium of communication between our minds and others. All we have todo is to accept this predigested nourishment, and ask no questions.We could live a whole life without ever making a really individualresponse, without providing ourselves out of our own experience withany of the material that our mind works on. Many of us seem to be justthis kind of spiritual parasite. We may learn and absorb and grow, upto a certain point. But eventually something captures us: we becomeencased in a suit of armor, and invulnerable to our own experience. Wehave lost the faculty of being surprised. It is this encasing that theironist fears, and it is the ironical method that he finds the best forpreventing it. Irony keeps the waters in motion, so that the ice neverhas a chance to form. The cut-and-dried life is easy to form becauseit has no sense of contrast; everything comes to one on its own terms,vouching for itself, and is accepted or rejected on its own good looks,and not for its fitness and place in the scheme of things.This is the courage and this the sympathy of irony. Have they nota beauty of their own comparable in excellence with the paler glowof religious virtue? And the understanding of the ironist althoughaggressive and challenging has its justification, too. For he is madto understand the world, to get to the bottom of other personalities.That is the reason for his constant classification. The ironist isthe most dogmatic of persons. To understand you he must grasp youfirmly, or he must pin you down definitely; if he accidentally nailsyou fast to a dogma that you indignantly repudiate, you must blamehis enthusiasm and not his method. Dogmatism is rarely popular, andthe ironist of course suffers. It hurts people’s eyes to see a stronglight, and the pleasant mist-land of ideas is much more emotionallywarming than the clear, sunny region of transmissible phrases. How theaverage person wriggles and squirms under these piercing attempts tocorner his personality! “Tell me what you mean!” or “What do you seein it?” are the fatal questions that the ironist puts, and who shallcensure him if he does display the least trace of malicious delight ashe watches the half-formed baby ideas struggle towards the light, orscurry around frantically to find some decent costume in which they mayappear in public?The judgments of the ironist are often discounted as being toosweeping. But he has a valid defense. Lack of classification isannihilation of thought. Even the newest philosophy will admit thatclassification is a necessary evil. Concepts are indispensable,--andyet each concept falsifies. The ironist must have as large a stock aspossible, but he must have a stock. And even the unjust classificationis marvelously effective. The ironist’s name for his opponent is achallenge to him. The more sweeping it is, the more stimulus it giveshim to repel the charge. He must explain just how he is unique andindividual in his attitude. And in this explanation he reveals anddiscovers all that the ironist wishes to know about him. A handful ofepithets is thus the ammunition of the ironist. He must call thingsby what seem to him to be their right names. In a sense, the ironistassumes the prisoner to be guilty until he proves himself innocent;but it is always in order that justice may be done, and that he maycome to learn the prisoner’s soul and all the wondrous things that arecontained there.It is this passion for comprehension that explains the ironist’sapparently scandalous propensity to publicity. Nothing seems to him toosacred to touch, nothing too holy for him to become witty about. Thereare no doors locked to him, there is nothing that can make good anyclaim of resistance to scrutiny. His free and easy manner of includingeverything within the sweep of his vision is but his recognition,however, of the fact that nothing is really so serious as we think itis, and nothing quite so petty. The ironist will descend in a momentfrom a discussion of religion to a squabble over a card-game, and hewill defend himself with the reflection that religion is after all ahuman thing and must be discussed in the light of everyday living,and that the card-game is an integral part of life, reveals thepersonalities of the players--and his own to himself--and being worthyof his interest is worthy of his enthusiasm. The ironist is apt totest things by their power to interest as much as by their nobility,and if he sees the incongruous and inflated in the lofty, so he seesthe significant in the trivial and raises it from its low degree.Many a mighty impostor does he put down from his seat. The ironist isthe great intellectual democrat, in whose presence and before whoselaw all ideas and attitudes stand equal. In his world there is noprivileged caste, no aristocracy of sentiments to be reverenced, orsegregated systems of interests to be tabooed. Nothing human is aliento the ironist; the whole world is thrown open naked to the play of hisjudgment.In the eyes of its detractors, irony has all the vices of democracy.Its publicity seems mere vulgarity, its free hospitality seems to shockall ideas of moral worth. The ironist is but a scoffer, they say, withweapon leveled eternally at all that is good and true and sacred. Theadoption of another’s point of view seems little better than maliciousdissimulation,--the repetition of others’ words, an elaborate mockery;the ironist’s eager interest seems a mere impudence or a lack offiner instincts; his interest in the trivial, the last confession ofa mean spirit; and his love of classifying, a proof of his povertyof imaginative resource. Irony, in other words, is thought to besynonymous with cynicism. But the ironist is no cynic. His is a kindly,not a sour interest in human motives. He wants to find out how thehuman machine runs, not to prove that it is a worthless, broken-downaffair. He accepts it as it comes, and if he finds it curiously feebleand futile in places, blame not him but the nature of things. He findsenough rich compensation in the unexpected charm that he constantlyfinds himself eliciting. The ironist sees life steadily and sees itwhole; the cynic only a distorted fragment.If the ironist is not cynic, neither is he merely a dealer in satire,burlesque and ridicule. Irony may be the raw material, innocent initself but capable of being put to evil uses. But it involves neitherthe malice of satire, nor the horse-play of burlesque, nor the stab ofridicule. Irony is infinitely finer and more delicate and impersonal.The satirist is always personal and concrete, but the ironist dealswith general principles, and broad aspects of human nature. It cannotbe too much emphasized that the function of the ironist is not tomake fun of people, but to give their souls an airing. The ironistis a judge on the bench, giving men a public hearing. He is not anaggressive spirit who goes about seeking whom he may devour, or aspiritual lawyer who courts litigation, but the judge before whom fileall the facts of his experience, the people he meets, the opinionshe hears or reads, his own attitudes and prepossessions. If any areconvicted they are self-convicted. The judge himself is passive,merciful, lenient. There is judgment, but no punishment. Or rather, thetrial itself is the punishment. Now satire is all that irony is not.The satirist is the aggressive lawyer, fastening upon particular peopleand particular qualities. But irony is no more personal than the sunthat sends his flaming darts into the world. The satirist is a purelypractical man, with a business instinct, bent on the main chance andthe definite object. He is often brutal, and always overbearing; theironist never. Irony may wound from the very fineness and delicacy ofits attack, but the wounding is incidental. The sole purpose of thesatirist and the burlesquer is to wound, and they test their successby the deepness of the wound. But irony tests its own by the amountof generous light and air it has set flowing through an idea or apersonality, and the broad significance it has revealed in neglectedthings.If irony is not brutal, neither is it merely critical and destructive.The world has some reason, it is true, to complain against the rathersupercilious judiciousness of the ironist. “Who are you to judge us?”it cries. The world does not like to feel the scrutinizing eyes of theironist as he sits back in his chair; does not like to feel that theironist is simply studying it and amusing himself at its expense. Itis uneasy, and acts sometimes as if it did not have a perfectly clearconscience. To this uncomfortableness the ironist can retort,--“Whatis it that you are afraid to have known about you?” If the judgmentamuses him, so much the worse for the world. But if the idea of theironist as judge implies that his attitude is wholly detached, whollyobjective, it is an unfortunate metaphor. For he is as much part andparcel of the human show as any of the people he studies. The worldis no stage, with the ironist as audience. His own personal reactionswith the people about him form all the stuff of his thoughts andjudgments. He has a personal interest in the case; his own personalityis inextricably mingled in the stream of impressions that flowspast him. If the ironist is destructive, it is his own world thathe is destroying; if he is critical, it is his own world that he iscriticizing. And his irony is his critique of life.This is the defense of the ironist against the charge that he hasa purely æsthetic attitude towards life. Too often, perhaps, thesparkling clarity of his thought, the play of his humor, the easysense of superiority and intellectual command that he carries off,make his irony appear as rather the æsthetic nourishment of his lifethan an active way of doing and being. His rather detached air makeshim seem to view people as means, not ends in themselves. With hisdelight in the vivid and poignant he is prone to see picturesquenessin the sordid, and tolerate evils that he should condemn. For allhis interest and activity, it is said that he does not really care.But this æsthetic taint to his irony is really only skin-deep. Theironist is ironical not because he does not care, but because he carestoo much. He is feeling the profoundest depths of the world’s greatbeating, laboring heart, and his playful attitude towards the grim andsordid is a necessary relief from the tension of too much caring. Itis his salvation from unutterable despair. The terrible urgency of thereality of poverty and misery and exploitation would be too strong uponhim. Only irony can give him a sense of proportion, and make his lifefruitful and resolute. It can give him a temporary escape, a slightmomentary reconciliation, a chance to draw a deep breath of resolvebefore plunging into the fight. It is not a palliative so much as aperspective. This is the only justification of the æsthetic attitude,that, if taken provisionally, it sweetens and fortifies. It is onlydeadly when adopted as absolute. The kind of æsthetic irony that Paterand Omar display is a paralyzed, half-seeing, half-caring reflectionon life,--a tame, domesticated irony with its wings cut, an irony thatfurnishes a justification and a command to inaction. It is the resultnot of exquisitely refined feelings, but of social anæsthesia. Theirirony, cut off from the great world of men and women and boys and girlsand their intricate interweavings and jostlings and incongruities,turns pale and sickly and numb. The ironist has no right to see beautyin things unless he really cares. The æsthetic sense is harmless onlywhen it is both ironical and social.Irony is thus a cure for both optimism and pessimism. Nothing is sorevolting to the ironist as the smiling optimist, who testifies in hisfatuous heedlessness to the desirability of this best of all possibleworlds. But the ironist has always an incorrigible propensity to seethe other side. The hopeless maladjustment of too many people to theirworld, of their bondage in the iron fetters of circumstance,--allthis is too glaring for the ironist’s placidity. When he examinesthe beautiful picture, too often the best turns worst to him. But ifoptimism is impossible to the ironist, so is pessimism. The ironistmay have a secret respect for the pessimist,--he at least has feltthe bitter tang of life, and has really cared,--but he feels thatthe pessimist lacks. For if the optimist is blind, the pessimist ishypnotized. He is abnormally suggestive to evil. But clear-sightedirony sees that the world is too big and multifarious to be evilat heart. Something beautiful and joyous lurks even in the mosthapless,--a child’s laugh in a dreary street, a smile on the face of aweary woman. It is this saving quality of irony that both optimist andpessimist miss. And since plain common sense tells us that things arenever quite so bad or quite so good as they seem, the ironist carriesconviction into the hearts of men in their best moments.The ironist is a person who counts in the world. He has all sorts ofunexpected effects on both the people he goes with and himself. Hisis an insistent personality; he is as troublesome as a missionary.And he is a missionary; for, his own purpose being a comprehension ofhis fellows’ souls, he makes them conscious of their own souls. Heis a hard man; he will take nothing on reputation; he will guaranteefor himself the qualities of things. He will not accept the vouchersof the world that a man is wise, or clever, or sincere, behind theimpenetrable veil of his face. He must probe until he elicits theevidence of personality, until he gets at the peculiar quality whichdistinguishes that individual soul. For the ironist is after all aconnoisseur in personality, and if his conversation partakes toooften of the character of cross-examination, it is only as a lover ofthe beautiful, a possessor of taste, that he inquires. He does notwant to see people squirm, but he does want to see whether they arealive or not. If he pricks too hard, it is not from malice, but merelyfrom error in his estimation of the toughness of their skins. Whatpeople are inside is the most interesting question in the world to theironist. And in finding out he stirs them up. Many a petty doubtingspirit does he challenge and bully into a sort of self-respect. Andmany a bag of wind does he puncture. But his most useful functionis this of stimulating thought and action. The ironist forces hisfriends to move their rusty limbs and unhinge the creaking doors oftheir minds. The world needs more ironists. Shut up with one’s ownthoughts, one loses the glow of life that comes from frank exchangeof ideas with many kinds of people. Too many minds are stuffy, dustyrooms into which the windows have never been opened,--minds heavywith their own crotchets, cluttered up with untested theories andconflicting sympathies that have never got related in any social way.The ironist blows them all helter-skelter, sweeps away the dust, andsets everything in its proper place again. Your solid, self-respectfulmind, the ironist confesses he can do little with; it is not of hisworld. He comes to freshen and tone up the stale minds. The ironist isthe great purger and cleanser of life. Irony is a sort of spiritualmassage, rubbing the souls of men. It may seem rough to some tendersouls, but it does not sere or scar them. The strong arm of the ironistrestores the circulation, and drives away anæmia.On the ironist himself the effect of irony is even more invigorating.We can never really understand ourselves without at least a touch ofirony. The interpretation of human nature without is a simple matterin comparison with the comprehension of that complex of elations anddisgusts, inhibitions and curious irrational impulses that we callourselves. It is not true that by examining ourselves and coming toan understanding of the way we behave we understand other people, butthat by the contrasts and little revelations of our friends we learnto interpret ourselves. Introspection is no match for irony as aguide. The most illuminating experience that we can have is a suddenrealization that had we been in the other person’s place we should haveacted precisely as he did. To the ironist this is no mere intellectualconviction that, after all, none of us are perfect, but a vividemotional experience which has knit him with that other person in onemoment in a bond of sympathy that could have been acquired in no otherway. Those minds that lack the touch of irony are too little flexible,or too heavily buttressed with self-esteem to make this sudden changeof attitudes. The ironist, one might almost say, gets his brotherhoodintuitively, feels the sympathy and the oneness in truth before hethinks them. The ironist is the only man who really gets outside ofhimself. What he does for other people,--that is, picking out a littlepiece of their souls and holding it up for their inspection,--he doesfor himself. He gets thus an objective view of himself. The unhealthyindoor brooding of introspection is artificial and unproductive,because it has no perspective or contrast. But the ironist withhis constant outdoor look sees his own foibles and humiliations inthe light of those of other people. He acquires a more tolerant,half-amused, half-earnest attitude toward himself. His self-respectis nourished by the knowledge that whatever things discreditable andfoolish and worthless he has done, he has seen them approximated byothers, and yet his esteem is kept safely pruned down by the recurringevidence that nothing he has is unique. He is poised in life, ready tosoar or to walk as the occasion demands. He is pivoted, susceptible toevery stimulus, and yet chained so that he cannot be flung off intospace by his own centrifugal force.Irony has the same sweetening and freshening effect on one’s own lifethat it has on the lives of those who come in contact with it. It givesone a command of one’s resources. The ironist practices a perfecteconomy of material. For he must utilize his wealth constantly andover and over again in various shapes and shadings. He may be poorin actual material, but out of the contrast and arrangement of thatslender store he is able, like a kaleidoscope, to make a multifariousvariety of wonderful patterns. His current coin is, so to speak, keptbright by constant exchange. He is infinitely richer than your opulentbut miserly minds that hoard up facts, and are impotent from the veryplethora of their accumulations.Irony is essential to any real honesty. For dishonesty is at bottomsimply an attempt to save somebody’s face. But the ironist does notwant any faces saved, neither his own nor those of other people. Tosave faces is to sophisticate human nature, to falsify the facts, andmiss a delicious contrast, an illuminating revelation of how peopleact. So the ironist is the only perfectly honest man. But he suffersfor it by acquiring a reputation for impudence. His willingness tobear the consequences of his own acts, his quiet insistence thatothers shall bear consequences, seem like mere shamelessness, a lackof delicate feeling for “situations.” But accustomed as he is to rangefreely and know no fear nor favor, he despises this reserve as aspecies of timidity or even hypocrisy. It is an irony itself that theone temperament that can be said really to appreciate human nature, inthe sense of understanding it rightly, should be called impudent, andit is another that it should be denounced as monstrously egotistical.The ironical mind is the only truly modest mind, for its point of viewis ever outside itself. If it calls attention to itself, it is only asanother of those fascinating human creatures that pass ever by withtheir bewildering, alluring ways. If it talks about itself, it is onlyas a third person in whom all the talkers are supposed to be eagerlyinterested. In this sense the ironist has lost his egotism completely.He has rubbed out the line that separates his personality from therest of the world.The ironist must take people very seriously, to spend so much time overthem. He must be both serious and sincere or he would not persist inhis irony and expose himself to so much misunderstanding. And since itis not how people treat him, but simply how they act, that furnishesthe basis for his appreciation, the ironist finds it easy to forgive.He has a way of letting the individual offense slide, in favor of adeeper principle. In the act of being grossly misrepresented, he canfeel a pang of exasperated delight that people should be so dense; inthe act of being taken in, he can feel the cleverness of it all. Hebecomes for the moment his enemy; and we can always forgive ourselves.Even while he is being insulted, or outraged or ignored, he can feel,“After all, this is what life is! This is the way we poor humancreatures behave!” The ironist is thus in a sense vicarious humannature. Through that deep, anticipatory sympathy, he is kept clean fromhate or scorn.The ironist therefore has a valid defense against all the charges ofbrutality and triviality and irreverence, that the religious man isprone to bring against him. He can care more deeply about thingsbecause he can see so much more widely. And he can take life veryseriously because it interests him so intensely. And he can feelits poignancy and its flux more keenly because he delivers himselfup bravely to its swirling, many-hued current. The inner peace ofreligion seems gained only at the expense of the reality of living. Alife such as the life of irony, lived fully and joyously, cannot bepeaceful; it cannot even be happy, in the sense of calm content andsatisfaction. But it can be better than either--it can be wise, and itcan be fruitful. And it can be good, in a way that the life of innerpeace cannot be. For the life of irony having no reserve and weavingitself out of the flux of experience rather than out of eternal valueshas the broad, honest sympathy of democracy, that is impossible to anytemperament with the aristocratic taint. One advantage the religiouslife has is a salvation in another world to which it can withdraw. Thelife of irony has laid up few treasures in heaven, but many in thisworld. Having gained so much it has much to lose. But its glory is thatit can lose nothing unless it lose all.To shafts of fortune and blows of friends or enemies then, the ironistis almost impregnable. He knows how to parry each thrust and preparefor every emergency. Even if the arrows reach him, all the poison hasbeen sucked out of them by his clear, resolute understanding of theirsignificance. There is but one weak spot in his armor, but one disasterthat he fears more almost than the loss of his life,--a shrinkage ofhis environment, a running dry of experience. He fears to be cut offfrom friends and crowds and human faces and speech and books, forhe demands to be ceaselessly fed. Like a modern city, he is totallydependent on a steady flow of supplies from the outside world, andwill be in danger of starvation, if the lines of communication areinterrupted. Without people and opinions for his mind to play on, hisirony withers and faints. He has not the faculty of brooding; he cannotmine the depths of his own soul, and bring forth after labor mightynuggets of thought. The flow and swirl of things is his compellinginterest. His thoughts are reactions, immediate and vivid, to his dailyexperience. Some deep, unconscious brooding must go on, to produce thathappy precision of judgment of his; but it is not voluntary. He isconscious only of the shifting light and play of life; his world isdynamic, energetic, changing. He lives in a world of relations, and hemust have a whole store of things to be related. He has lost himselfcompletely in this world he lives in. His ironical interpretationof the world is his life, and this world is his nourishment. Takeaway this environmental world and you have slain his soul. He isinvulnerable to everything except that deprivation.VTHE EXCITEMENT OF FRIENDSHIPMy friends, I can say with truth, since I have no other treasure,are my fortune. I really live only when I am with my friends. Thosesufficient persons who can pass happily long periods of solitudecommuning with their own thoughts and nourishing their own soulsfill me with a despairing admiration. Their gift of auto-stimulationargues a personal power which I shall never possess. Or else itargues, as I like to think in self-defense, a callousness of spirit,an insensitiveness to the outside influences which nourish and sustainthe more susceptible mind. And those persons who can shut themselvesup for long periods and work out their thoughts alone, constructingbeautiful and orderly representations of their own spirits, are to me acontinual mystery. I know this is the way that things are accomplished,that “monotony and solitude” are necessary for him who would producecreative thought. Yet, knowing well this truth, I shun them both. I ama battery that needs to be often recharged. I require the excitementof friendship; I must have the constant stimulation of friends. I donot spark automatically, but must have other minds to rub up against,and strike from them by friction the spark that will kindle my thoughts.When I walk, I must have a friend to talk to, or I shall not eventhink. I am not of those who, like Stevenson, believe that walkingshould be a kind of vegetative stupor, where the sun and air merelyfill one with a diffused sense of well-being and exclude definitethought. The wind should rather blow through the dusty regions of themind, and the sun light up its dark corners, and thinking and talkingshould be saner and higher and more joyful than within doors. But onemust have a friend along to open the windows. Neither can I sympathizewith those persons who carry on long chains of reasoning while theyare traveling or walking. When alone, my thinking is as desultory asthe scenery of the roadside, and when with a friend, it is apt tobe as full of romantic surprises as a walk through a woodland glen.Good talk is like good scenery--continuous yet constantly varying,and full of the charm of novelty and surprise. How unnatural it isto think except when one is forced to do it, is discovered when oneattempts to analyze one’s thoughts when alone. He is a rare genius whofinds something beyond the mere visual images that float through hismind,--either the reflection of what he is actually seeing, or thepictorial representations of what he has been doing or what he wantsor intends to do in the near or far future. We should be shocked toconfess to ourselves how little control we have over our own minds; weshall be lucky if we can believe that we guide them.Thinking, then, was given us for use in emergencies, and no man canbe justly blamed if he reserves it for emergencies. He can be blamed,however, if he does not expose himself to those crises which will callit forth. Now a friend is such an emergency, perhaps the most excitingstimulus to thinking that one can find, and if one wants to live beyondthe vegetative stupor, one must surround one’s self with friends. Ishall call my friends, then, all those influences which warm me andstart running again all my currents of thought and imagination. Thepersons, causes, and books that unlock the prison of my intellectualtorpor, I can justly call my friends, for I find that I feel towardthem all the same eager joy and inexhaustible rush of welcome. Wherethey differ it shall be in degree and not in kind. The speaker whomI hear, the book that I read, the friend with whom I chat, the musicthat I play, even the blank paper before me, which subtly stirs meto cover it with sentences that unfold surprisingly and entice me tofollow until I seem hopelessly lost from the trail,--all these shall bemy friends as long as I find myself responding to them, and no longer.They are all alike in being emergencies that call upon me for instantand definite response.The difference between them lies in their response to me. My personalfriends react upon me; the lecturers and books and music and picturesdo not. These are not influenced by my feelings or by what I do. Ican approach them cautiously or boldly, respond to them slowly orwarmly, and they will not care. They have a definite quality, and donot change; if I respond differently to them at different times, Iknow that it is I and not they who have altered. The excitement offriendship does not lie with them. One feels this lack particularlyin reading, which no amount of enthusiasm can make more than a feebleand spiritless performance. The more enthusiasm the reading inspiresin one, the more one rebels at the passivity into which one is forced.I want to get somehow at grips with the book. I can feel the warmthof the personality behind it, but I cannot see the face as I can theface of a person, lighting and changing with the iridescent play ofexpression. It is better with music; one can get at grips with one’spiano, and feel the resistance and the response of the music one plays.One gets the sense of aiding somehow in its creation, the lack of whichfeeling is the fatal weakness of reading, though itself the easiestand most universal of friendly stimulations. One comes from muchreading with a sense of depression and a vague feeling of somethingunsatisfied; from friends or music one comes with a high sense ofelation and of the brimming adequacy of life.If one could only retain those moments! What a tragedy it is that ourperiods of stimulated thinking should be so difficult of reproduction;that there is no intellectual shorthand to take down the keenthoughts, the trains of argument, the pregnant thoughts, which springso spontaneously to the mind at such times! What a tragedy that onemust wait till the fire has died out, till the light has faded away,to transcribe the dull flickering remembrances of those golden hourswhen thought and feeling seemed to have melted together, and onesaid and thought what seemed truest and finest and most worthy ofone’s immortalizing! This is what constitutes the hopeless labor ofwriting,--that one must struggle constantly to warm again the thoughtsthat are cold or have been utterly consumed. What was thought in thehours of stimulation must be written in the hours of solitude, when themind is apt to be cold and gray, and when one is fortunate to find onthe hearth of the memory even a few scattered embers lying about. Theblood runs sluggish as one sits down to write. What worry and strivingit takes to get it running freely again! What labor to reproduce evena semblance of what seemed to come so genially and naturally in thecontact and intercourse of friendship!One of the curious superstitions of friendship is that we somehowchoose our friends. To the connoisseur in friendship no idea could bemore amazing and incredible. Our friends are chosen for us by somehidden law of sympathy, and not by our conscious wills. All we knowis that in our reactions to people we are attracted to some and areindifferent to others. And the ground of this mutual interest seemsbased on no discoverable principles of similarity of temperament orcharacter. We have no time, when meeting a new person, to study him orher carefully; our reactions are swift and immediate. Our minds aremade up instantly,--“friend or non-friend.” By some subtle intuitions,we know and have measured at their first words all the possibilitieswhich their friendship has in store for us. We get the full quality oftheir personality at the first shock of meeting, and no future intimacychanges that quality.If I am to like a man, I like him at once; further acquaintancecan only broaden and deepen that liking and understanding. If I amdestined to respond, I respond at once or never. If I do not respond,he continues to be to me as if I had never met him; he does not existin my world. His thoughts, feelings, and interests I can but dimlyconceive of; if I do think of him it is only as a member of somegeneral class. My imaginative sympathy can embrace him only as a type.If his interests are in some way forced upon my attention, and myimagination is compelled to encompass him as an individual, I find hisideas and interests appearing like pale, shadowy things, dim ghosts ofthe real world that my friends and I live in.Association with such aliens--and how much of our life is necessarilyspent in their company--is a torture far worse than being actuallydisliked. Probably they do not dislike us, but there is this strangegulf which cuts us off from their possible sympathy. A pall seemsto hang over our spirits; our souls are dumb. It is a struggle andan effort to affect them at all. And though we may know that thisdepressing weight which seems to press on us in our intercoursewith them has no existence, yet this realization does not cure ourhelplessness. We do not exist for them any more than they exist forus. They are depressants, not stimulators as are our friends. Ourwords sound singularly futile and half-hearted as they pass our lips.Our thoughts turn to ashes as we utter them. In the grip of thispredestined antipathy we can do nothing but submit and pass on.But in how different a light do we see our friends! They are no types,but each a unique, exhaustless personality, with his own absorbinglittle cosmos of interests round him. And those interests are real andvital, and in some way interwoven with one’s own cosmos. Our friendsare those whose worlds overlap our own, like intersecting circles.If there is too much overlapping, however, there is monotony and amutual cancellation. It is, perhaps, a question of attitude as much asanything. Our friends must be pointed in the same direction in which weare going, and the truest friendship and delight is when we can watcheach other’s attitude toward life grow increasingly similar; or if notsimilar, at least so sympathetic as to be mutually complementary andsustaining.The wholesale expatriation from our world of all who do not overlap usor look at life in a similar direction is so fatal to success that wecannot afford to let these subtle forces of friendship and apathy havefull sway with our souls. To be at the mercy of whatever preordainedrelations may have been set up between us and the people we meet isto make us incapable of negotiating business in a world where onemust be all things to all men. From an early age, therefore, we work,instinctively or consciously, to get our reactions under control, soas to direct them in the way most profitable to us. By a slow andimperceptible accretion of impersonality over the erratic tendenciesof personal response and feeling, we acquire the professionalmanner, which opens the world wide to us. We become human patternsof the profession into which we have fallen, and are no longerindividual personalities. Men find no difficulty in becoming soon soprofessionalized that their manner to their children at home is almostidentical with that to their clients in the office. Such an extinctionof the personality is a costly price to pay for worldly success. Onehas integrated one’s character, perhaps, but at the cost of the zestand verve and peril of true friendship.To those of us, then, who have not been tempted by success, or whohave been so fortunate as to escape it, friendship is a life-longadventure. We do not integrate ourselves, and we have as many sides toour character as we have friends to show them to. Quite unconsciously Ifind myself witty with one friend, large and magnanimous with another,petulant and stingy with another, wise and grave with another, andutterly frivolous with another. I watch with surprise the suddenand startling changes in myself as I pass from the influence of onefriend to the influence of some one else. But my character with eachparticular friend is constant. I find myself, whenever I meet him,with much the same emotional and mental tone. If we talk, there iswith each one some definite subject upon which we always speak andwhich remains perennially fresh and new. If I am so unfortunate as tostray accidentally from one of these well-worn fields into another, Iam instantly reminded of the fact by the strangeness and chill of theatmosphere. We are happy only on our familiar levels, but on thesewe feel that we could go on exhaustless forever, without a pang ofennui. And this inexhaustibility of talk is the truest evidence of goodfriendship.Friends do not, on the other hand, always talk of what is nearestto them. Friendship requires that there be an open channel betweenfriends, but it does not demand that that channel be the deepest in ournature. It may be of the shallowest kind and yet the friendship be ofthe truest. For all the different traits of our nature must get theirairing through friends, the trivial as well as the significant. We letourselves out piecemeal, it seems, so that only with a host of variedfriends can we express ourselves to the fullest. Each friend calls outsome particular trait in us, and it requires the whole chorus fitly toteach us what we are. This is the imperative need of friendship. A manwith few friends is only half-developed; there are whole sides of hisnature which are locked up and have never been expressed. He cannotunlock them himself, he cannot even discover them; friends alone canstimulate him and open them. Such a man is in prison; his soul is inpenal solitude. A man must get friends as he would get food and drinkfor nourishment and sustenance. And he must keep them, as he would keephealth and wealth, as the infallible safeguards against misery andpoverty of spirit.If it seems selfish to insist so urgently upon one’s need for friends,if it should be asked what we are giving our friends in return forall their spiritual fortification and nourishment, the defense wouldhave to be, that we give back to them in ample measure what they giveto us. If we are their friends, we are stimulating them as they arestimulating us. They will find that they talk with unusual brilliancywhen they are with us. And we may find that we have, perhaps, merelylistened to them. Yet through that curious bond of sympathy which hasmade us friends, we have done as much for them as if we had exertedourselves in the most active way. The only duty of friendship is thatwe and our friends should live at our highest and best when together.Having achieved that, we have fulfilled the law.A good friendship, strange to say, has little place for mutualconsolations and ministrations. Friendship breathes a more rugged air.In sorrow the silent pressure of the hand speaks the emotions, andlesser griefs and misfortunes are ignored or glossed over. The fatalfacility of women’s friendships, their copious outpourings of grief toeach other, their sharing of wounds and sufferings, their half-pleasedinterest in misfortune,--all this seems of a lesser order than therobust friendships of men, who console each other in a much moresubtle, even intuitive way,--by a constant pervading sympathy which isfelt rather than expressed. For the true atmosphere of friendship isa sunny one. Griefs and disappointments do not thrive in its clear,healthy light. When they do appear, they take on a new color. Thesilver lining appears, and we see even our own personal mistakes andchagrins as whimsical adventures. It is almost impossible seriouslyto believe in one’s bad luck or failures or incapacity while one istalking with a friend. One achieves a sort of transfiguration ofpersonality in those moments. In the midst of the high and genial flowof intimate talk, a pang may seize one at the thought of the next day’sdrudgery, when life will be lived alone again; but nothing can dispelthe ease and fullness with which it is being lived at the moment. Itis, indeed, a heavy care that will not dissolve into misty air at themagic touch of a friend’s voice.Fine as friendship is, there is nothing irrevocable about it. Thebonds of friendship are not iron bonds, proof against the strongest ofstrains and the heaviest of assaults. A man by becoming your friendhas not committed himself to all the demands which you may be pleasedto make upon him. Foolish people like to test the bonds of theirfriendships, pulling upon them to see how much strain they will stand.When they snap, it is as if friendship itself had been proved unworthy.But the truth is that good friendships are fragile things and requireas much care in handling as any other fragile and precious things.For friendship is an adventure and a romance, and in adventures it isthe unexpected that happens. It is the zest of peril that makes theexcitement of friendship. All that is unpleasant and unfavorable isforeign to its atmosphere; there is no place in friendship for harshcriticism or fault-finding. We will “take less” from a friend than wewill from one who is indifferent to us.Good friendship is lived on a warm, impetuous plane; the long-sufferingkind of friendship is a feeble and, at best, a half-hearted affair.It is friendship in the valley and not on the breezy heights. For thesecret of friendship is a mutual admiration, and it is the realizationor suspicion that that admiration is lessening on one side or the otherthat swiftly breaks the charm. Now this admiration must have in it notaint of adulation, which will wreck a friendship as soon as suspicionwill. But it must consist of the conviction, subtly expressed in everytone of the voice, that each has found in the other friend a rarespirit, compounded of light and intelligence and charm. And there mustbe no open expression of this feeling, but only the silent flattery,soft and almost imperceptible.And in the best of friendships this feeling is equal on both sides.Too great a superiority in our friend disturbs the balance, and castsa sort of artificial light on the talk and intercourse. We want tobelieve that we are fairly equal to our friends in power and capacity,and that if they excel us in one trait, we have some counterbalancingquality in another direction. It is the reverse side of this shieldthat gives point to the diabolical insight of the Frenchman whoremarked that we were never heartbroken by the misfortunes of ourbest friends. If we have had misfortunes, it is not wholly unjust andunfortunate that our friends should suffer too. Only their misfortunesmust not be worse than ours. For the equilibrium is then destroyed,and our serious alarm and sympathy aroused. Similarly we rejoice inthe good fortune of our friends, always provided that it be not toodazzling or too undeserved.It is these aspects of friendship, which cannot be sneered away by thereproach of jealousy, that make friendship a precarious and adventurousthing. But it is precious in proportion to its precariousness, and itslittlenesses are but the symptoms of how much friends care, and howsensitive they are to all the secret bonds and influences that unitethem.Since our friends have all become woven into our very selves, to partfrom friends is to lose, in a measure, one’s self. He is a brave andhardy soul who can retain his personality after his friends are gone.And since each friend is the key which unlocks an aspect of one’s ownpersonality, to lose a friend is to cut away a part of one’s self. Imay make another friend to replace the loss, but the unique qualityof the first friend can never be brought back. He leaves a wound whichheals only gradually. To have him go away is as bad as to have him passto another world. The letter is so miserable a travesty on the personalpresence, a thin ghost of the thought of the once-present friend. Itis as satisfactory as a whiff of stale tobacco smoke to the lover ofsmoking.Those persons and things, then, that inspire us to do our best, thatmake us live at our best, when we are in their presence, that callforth from us our latent and unsuspected personality, that nourish andsupport that personality,--those are our friends. The reflection oftheir glow makes bright the darker and quieter hours when they are notwith us. They are a true part of our widest self; we should hardly havea self without them. Their world is one where chagrin and failure donot enter. Like the sun-dial, they “only mark the shining hours.”VITHE ADVENTURE OF LIFEThat life is an adventure it needs nothing more than the wonder ofour being in the world and the precariousness of our stay in it toinform us. Although we are, perhaps, as the scientists tell us, mereinert accompaniments of certain bundles of organized matter, we tendincorrigibly to think of ourselves as unique personalities. And aswe let our imagination roam over the world and dwell on the infinitevariety of scenes and thoughts and feelings and forms of life, wewonder at the incredible marvel that has placed us just here in thisage and country and locality where we were born. That it should bethis particular place and time and body that my consciousness isilluminating gives, indeed, the thrill of wonder and adventure to themere fact of my becoming and being.And as life goes on, the feeling for the precariousness of that beinggrows upon one’s mind. The security of childhood gives place to anawareness of the perils of misfortune, disease, and sudden death whichseem to lie in wait for men and seize them without regard to theirchoices or deserts. We are prone, of course, to believe in our personalluck; it is the helplessness of others around us rather that impressesus, as we see both friends and strangers visited with the most dreadfulevils, and with an impartiality of treatment that gradually tends toforce upon us the conviction that we, too, are not immune. At somestage in our life, oftenest perhaps when the first flush of youth ispast, we are suddenly thrown into a suspicion of life, a dread ofnameless and unforeseeable ill, and a sober realization of the needof circumspection and defense. We discover that we live in a worldwhere almost anything is likely to happen. Shocking accidents thatcut men off in their prime, pain and suffering falling upon the justand the unjust, maladjustments and misunderstandings that poison andruin lives,--all these things are daily occurrences in our experience,either of personal knowledge or out of that wider experience of ourreading.Religion seems to give little consolation in the face of suchincontrovertible facts. For no belief in Providence can gainsay theseeming fact that we are living in a world that is run without regardto the health and prosperity of its inhabitants. Whatever its ulteriormeanings, they do not seem to be adjusted to our scale of values.Physical law we can see, but where are the workings of a moral law?If they are present, they seem to cut woefully against the grain ofthe best desires and feelings of men. Evil seems to be out of allproportion to the ability of its sufferers to bear it, or of itschastening and corrective efficacy. Our feelings are too sensitive forthe assaults which the world makes upon them. If the responsibilityfor making all things work together for his good is laid entirelyupon man, it is a burden too heavy for his weakness and ignorance tobear. And thus we contemplate the old, old problem of evil. And in itscontemplation, the adventure of life, which should be a tonic and aspur, becomes a depressant; instead of nerving, it intimidates, andmakes us walk cautiously and sadly through life, where we should ridefast and shout for joy.In these modern days, the very wealth of our experience overwhelms us,and makes life harder to live in the sight of evil. The broadening ofcommunication, giving us a connection through newspapers and magazineswith the whole world, has made our experience almost as wide as theworld. In that experience, however, we get all the world’s horrorsas well as its interests and delights. Thus has it been that thiswidening, which has meant the possibility of living the contemplativeand imaginative life on an infinitely higher plane than before, hasmeant also a soul-sickness to the more sensitive, because of theimmense and over-burdening drafts on their sympathy which the newexperience involved. Although our increased knowledge of the world hasmeant everywhere reform, and has vastly improved and beautified lifefor millions of men, it has at the same time opened a nerve the painof which no opiate has been able to soothe. And along with the realincrease of longevity and sounder health for civilized man, attainedthrough the triumphs of medical science, there has come a renewedrealization of the shortness and precariousness, at its best, of life.The fact that our knowledge of evil is shared by millions of menintensifies, I think, our sensitiveness. Through the genius of displaywriters, thousands of readers are enabled to be present imaginativelyat scenes of horror. The subtle sense of a vast concourse havingwitnessed the scene magnifies its potency to the individual mind, andgives it the morbid touch as of crowds witnessing an execution.Our forefathers were more fortunate, and could contemplate evil morephilosophically and objectively. Their experience was happily limitedto what the normal soul could endure. Their evil was confined totheir vicinity. What dim intelligence of foreign disaster and miseryleaked in, only served to purify and sober their spirits. Evil didnot then reverberate around the world as it does now. Their nerveswere not strained or made raw by the reiterations and expatiationson far-away pestilence and famine, gigantic sea disasters, wantonmurders, or even the shocking living conditions of the great cityslums. Their imaginations had opportunity to grow healthily, unassailedby the morbidities of distant evil, which seems magnified and ominousthrough its very strangeness. They were not forced constantly to askthemselves the question, “What kind of a world do we live in anyhow?Has it no mercy and no hope?” They were not having constantly thrownup to them a justification of the universe. Perhaps it was becausethey were more concerned with personal sin than with objective evil.The enormity of sin against their Maker blotted out all transientmisfortune and death. But it was more likely that the actual ignoranceof that evil permitted their personal flagrancies to loom up larger intheir sight. Whatever the cause, there was a difference. We have onlyto compare their literature--solid, complacent, rational--with ourrestless and hectic stuff; or contrast their portraits--well-nourished,self-respecting faces--with the cheap or callous or hunted faces thatwe see about us to-day, to get the change in spiritual fibre which thisopening of the world has wrought. It has been a real eating of the treeof the knowledge of good and evil. A social conscience has been born.An expansion of soul has been forced upon us. We have the double needof a broader vision to assimilate the good that is revealed to us, anda stronger courage to bear the evil with which our slowly-bettering oldworld still seems to reek.But the youth of this modern generation are coming more and more tosee that the gloom and hysteria of this restless age, with all theother seemingly neurotic symptoms of decay, are simply growing-pains.They signify a better spiritual health that is to be. The soul isnow learning to adjust itself to the new conditions, to embrace thewide world that is its heritage, and not to reel and stagger beforethe assaults of a malign power. Life will always be fraught with realperil, but it is peril which gives us the sense of adventure. And as wegain in our command over the resources, both material and spiritual,of the world, we shall see the adventure as not so much the peril ofevil as an opportunity of permanent achievement. We can only cure oursuffering from the evil in the world by doing all in our power towipe out that which is caused by human blundering, and prevent whatwe can prevent by our control of the forces of nature. Our own littlepersonal evils we can dismiss with little thought. Such as have cometo us we can endure,--for have we not already endured them?--and thosethat we dread we shall not keep away by fear or worry. We can easilybecome as much slaves to precaution as we can to fear. Although we cannever rivet our fortune so tight as to make it impregnable, we may byour excessive prudence squeeze out of the life that we are guardingso anxiously all the adventurous quality that makes it worth living.In the light of our own problematical misfortune, we must rather livefreely and easily, taking the ordinary chances and looking To-morrowconfidently in the face as we have looked To-day. I have come thus farsafely and well; why may I not come farther?But in regard to the evil that we see around us, the problem is moredifficult. Though the youth of this generation hope to conquer, thebattle is still on. We have fought our way to a knowledge of things asthey are, and we must now fight our way beyond it. That first fightwas our first sense of the adventure of life. Our purpose early becameto track the world relentlessly down to its lair. We were resoluteto find out the facts, no matter how sinister and barren they provedthemselves to be. We would make no compromises with our desires,or with those weak persons who could not endure the clear light ofreality. We were scornful in the presence of the superstitions of ourelders. We could not conceive that sufficient knowledge combined withaction would not be able to solve all our problems and make clear allour path. As our knowledge grew, so did our courage. We pressed moreeagerly on the trail of this world of ours, purposing to capture andtame its mysteries, and reveal it as it is, so that none could doubtus. As we penetrated farther, however, into the cave, the path becamemore and more uncertain. We discovered our prey to be far grimmer andmore dangerous than we had ever imagined. As he turned slowly at bay,we discovered that he was not only repulsive but threatening. We weresternly prepared to accept him just as we found him, exulting that weshould know things as they really were. We were ready for the worst,and yet somehow not for this worst. We had not imagined him retaliatingupon us. In our first recoil, the thought flashed upon us that ourtracking him to his lair might end in his feasting on our bones.It is somewhat thus that we feel when the full implications of thematerialism to which we have laboriously fought our way dawn uponus, or we realize the full weight of the sodden social misery aroundus. Hitherto we have been so intent on the trail that we have notstopped to consider what it all meant. Now that we know, not onlyour own salvation seems threatened, but that of all around us, eventhe integrity of the world itself. In these moments of perplexityand alarm, we lose confidence in ourselves and all our values andinterpretations. To go further seems to be to court despair. We areashamed to retreat, and, besides, have come too far ever to get backinto the safe plain of ignorance again. The world seems to be revealedto us as mechanical in its workings and fortuitous in its origin, andthe warmth and light of beauty and ideals that we have known all alongto be our true life seem to be proven illusions. And the wailing of theworld comes up to us, cast off from any divine assistance, left to themercy of its own weak wills and puny strengths. In this fall, our worlditself seems to have lost merit, and we feel ourselves almost degradedby being a part of it. We have suddenly been deprived of our souls; theworld seems to have beaten us in our first real battle with it.Now this despair is partly the result of an excessive responsibilitythat we have taken for the universe. In youth, if we are earnest andeager, we tend to take every bit of experience that comes to us,as either a justification or a condemnation of the world. We areall instinctive monists at that age, and crave a complete whole. Aswe unconsciously construct our philosophy of life, each fact getsautomatically recorded as confirming or denying the competency ofthe world we live in. Even the first shock of disillusionment, whichbanishes those dreams of a beautiful, orderly, and rational world thathad suffused childhood with their golden light, did not shatter theconviction that there was somehow at least a Lord’s side. The suddenclosing of the account in the second shock, when the world turns on us,shows us how mighty has been the issue at stake,--nothing less than ourfaith in the universe, and, perhaps, in the last resort, of our faithin ourselves. We see now that our breathless seriousness of youth wasall along simply a studying of our crowded experience to see whether itwas on the Lord’s side or not. And now in our doubt we are left with aweight on our souls which is not our own, a burden which we have reallyusurped.In its adventure with evil, youth must not allow this strange,metaphysical responsibility to depress and incapacitate it. We shallnever face life freely and bravely and worthily if we do. I may wonder,it is true, as I look out on these peaceful fields, with the warmsun and blue sky above me and the kindly faces of my good friendsaround me, how this can be the same world that houses the millionsof poor and wretched people in their burning and huddled quarters inthe city. Can these days, in which I am free to come and go and walkand study as I will, be the same that measure out the long hours ofdrudgery to thousands of youth amid the whir of machines, and theselong restful nights of mine, the same that are for them only gaspsbreaking a long monotony? It must be the same world, however, whetherwe can ever reconcile ourselves to it or not. But we need plainly feelno responsibility for what happened previously to our generation. Ourresponsibility now is a collective, a social responsibility. And it isonly for the evil that society might prevent were it organized wiselyand justly. Beyond that it does not go. For the accidental evil that isshowered upon the world, we are not responsible, and we need not feeleither that the integrity of the universe is necessarily compromised byit. It is necessary to be somewhat self-centred in considering it. Wemust trust our own feelings rather than any rational proof. In spiteof everything, the world seems to us so unconquerably good, it affordsso many satisfactions, and is so rich in beauty and kindliness, thatwe have a right to assume that there is a side of things that we missin our pessimistic contemplation of misfortune and disaster. We seeonly the outer rind of it. People usually seem to be so much happierthan we can find any very rational excuse for their being, and thatold world that confronted us and scared us may look very much worsethan it really is. And we can remember that adding to the number of thesufferers does not intensify the actual quality of the suffering. Thereis no more suffering than one person can bear.These considerations may allay a little our first terror and despair.When we really understand that the world is not damned by the evil init, we shall be ready to see it in its true light as a challenge to ourheroisms. Not how evil came into the world, but how we are going to getit out, becomes the problem. Not by brooding over the hopeless, but bylaying plans for the possible will we shoulder our true responsibility.We shall find then that we had no need of despair. We were on theright track. When the world that we were tracking down turned at bay,he threatened more than he was able to perform. Not less science butmore science do we need in order that we may more and more get intoour control the forces and properties of nature, and guide them forour benefit. But we must learn that the interpretation of the worldlies not in its mechanism but in its meanings, and those meanings wefind in our values and ideals, which are very real to us. Sciencebrings us only to an “area of our dwelling,” as Whitman says. Themoral adventure of the rising generation will be to learn this truththoroughly, and to reinstate ideals and personality at the heart of theworld.Our most favorable battle-ground against evil will for some time atleast be the social movement. Poverty and sin and social injusticewe must feel not sentimentally nor so much a symptom of a guiltyconscience as a call to coöperate with the exploited and sufferers inthrowing off their ills. Sensitiveness to evil will be most fruitfulwhen it rouses a youth to the practical encouragement of the under-mento save themselves. Youth to-day needs to “beat the gong of revolt.”The oppressed seldom ask for our sympathy, and this is right andfitting; for they do not need it. (It might even make them contentedwith their lot.) What they need is the inspiration and the knowledge tocome into their own. All we can ever do in the way of good to peopleis to encourage them to do good to themselves. “Who would be free,himself must strike the blow!” This is the social responsibility ofmodern youth. It must not seek to serve humanity so much as to rouseand teach it. The great moral adventure that lies still ahead of us isto call men to the expansion of their souls to the wide world whichhas suddenly been revealed to them.       *       *       *       *       *Perhaps with that expansion youth will finally effect a reconciliationwith life of those two supremest and most poignant of adventures: thethoughts that cluster around sex, and the fears and hopes that clusteraround death, the one the gateway into life, the other out of it. Youthfinds them the two hardest aspects of life to adjust with the rest ofthe world in which we live. They are ever-present and pervasive, andyet their manifestations always cause us surprise, and shock us as ofsomething unwonted intruding in our daily affairs. They are the unseenspectres behind life, of which we are always dimly conscious, but whichwe are always afraid to meet boldly and face to face. We speak of themfurtively, or in far-away poetical strains. They are the materialsfor the tragedies of life, of its pathos and wistfulness, of itssplendors and defeats. Yet they are treated always with an incorrigibleand dishonest delicacy. The world, youth soon finds, is a much lessorderly and refined place than would appear on the surface of our dailyintercourse and words. As we put on our best clothes to appear inpublic, so the world puts on its best clothes to appear in talk andprint.Men ignore death, as if they were quite unconscious that it wouldsometime come to them, yet who knows how many pensive or terriblemoments the thought gives them? But the spectre is quite invisible tous. Or if they have passions, and respond as sensitively as a vibratingstring to sex influences and appeals, we have little indication of thatthrobbing life behind the impenetrable veil of their countenances. Wecan know what people think about all other things, even what they thinkabout God, but what they think of these two adventures of sex and deathwe never know. It is not so much, I am willing to believe, shame orfear that keeps us from making a parade of them, as awe and wonder andbaffled endeavors to get our attitude towards them into expressibleform. They are too elemental, too vast and overpowering in theirworkings to fit neatly into this busy, accounted-for, and tied-downworld of daily life. They are superfluous to what we see as thehigher meanings of this our life, and irritate us by their clamorousinsistence and disregard for the main currents of our living. They seemirrelevant to life; or rather they overtop its bounty. Their pressureto be let in is offensive, and taints and mars irrevocably what wouldotherwise be so pleasant and secure a life. That is, perhaps, why wecall manifestations of sex activity, obscene, and of death, morbid andghastly.In these modern days we are adopting a healthier attitude, especiallytowards sex. Perhaps the rising generation will be successful inreconciling them both, and working them into our lives, where they maybe seen in their right relations and proportions, and no longer thepleasure of sex and the peace of death seem an illegitimate obtrusioninto life. To get command of these arch-enemies is an endeavor worthyof the moral heroes of to-day. We can get control, it seems, of therest of our souls, but these always lie in wait to torment and harassus. To tame this obsession of sex and the fear of death will be aHerculean task for youth in the adventure of life. Perhaps some willsucceed where we have failed. For usually when we try to tame sex, itpoisons the air around us, and if we try to tame the fear of death byresigning ourselves to its inevitability, we find that we have nottamed it but only drugged it. At certain times, however, our struggleswith the winged demons which they send into our minds may constitutethe most poignant incidents in our adventure of life, and add a beautyto our lives. Where they do not make for happiness, they may at leastmake for a deepening of knowledge and appreciation of life. Alongthrough middle life, we shall find, perhaps, that, even if untamed,they have become our allies, and that both have lost their sting andtheir victory,--sex diffusing our life with a new beauty, and deathwith a courageous trend towards a larger life of which we shall be anintegral part.When we have acclimated ourselves to youth, suddenly death looms upas the greatest of dangers in our adventure of life. It puzzles andshocks and saddens us by its irrevocability and mystery. That we shouldbe taken out of this world to which we are so perfectly adapted, andwhich we enjoy and feel intimate with, is an incredible thing. Even ifwe believe that we shall survive death, we know that that after-lifemust perforce be lived outside of this our familiar world. Reason tellsus that we shall be annihilated, and yet we cannot conceive our ownannihilation. We can easier imagine the time before our birth, when wewere not, than the time after our death, when we shall not be. Old menfind nothing very dreadful in the thought of being no more, and weshall find that it is the combined notion of being annihilated, and yetof being somehow conscious of that annihilation, that terrifies us, andstartles our minds sometimes in the dead of night when our spirits aresluggish and the ghoulish ideas that haunt the dimmest chambers of themind are flitting abroad. We can reason with ourselves that if we areannihilated we shall not be conscious of it, and if we are conscious weshall not be annihilated, but this easy proof does not help us much ina practical way. We simply do not know, and all speculations seem to beequally legitimate. If we are destined to assume another form of life,no divination can prophesy for us what that life shall be.On the face of it the soul as well as the body dies. The fate of thebody we know, and it seems dreadful enough to chill the stoutest heart;and what we call our souls seem so intimately dependent upon thesebodies as to be incapable of living alone. And yet somehow it is hardto stop believing in the independent soul. We can believe that thewarmth dissipates, that the chemical and electrical energies of thebody pass into other forms and are gradually lost in the immensity ofthe universe. But this wonder of consciousness, which seems to holdand embrace all our thoughts and feelings and bind them together, whatcan we know of its power and permanence? In our own limited sphere italready transcends space and time, our imaginations triumphing overspace, and our memories and anticipations over time: this magic powerof the imagination, which transcends our feeble experience and givesideas and images which have not appeared directly through the senses.We can connect this conscious life with no other aspect of the worldnor can we explain it by any of the principles which we apply tophysical things. It is the divine gift that reveals this world; why mayit not reveal sometime a far wider universe?It is this incalculability of our conscious life that makes its seemingend so great an adventure. This Time which rushes past us, blottingout everything it creates, leaving us ever suspended on a Present,which, as we turn to look at it, has melted away,--how are we tocomprehend it? The thin, fragile and uncertain stream of our memoryseems insufficient to give any satisfaction of permanence. I like tothink of a world-memory that retains the past. Physical things thatchange or perish continue to live psychically in memory; why may notall that passes, not only in our minds, but unknown to us, be carriedalong in a great world-mind of whose nature we get a dim inklingeven now in certain latent mental powers of ours which are sometimesrevealed, and seem to let down bars into a boundless sea of knowledge.The world is a great, rushing, irreversible life, not predestined inits workings, but free like ourselves. The accumulating past seems tocut into the future, and create it as it goes along. Nothing is thenlost, and we, although we had no existence before we were born,--howcould we have, since that moving Present had not created us?--wouldyet, having been born, continue to exist in that world-memory. We donot need to reëcho the sadness of the centuries,--“Everything passes;nothing remains!” For even if we take this world-memory at its lowestterms as a social memory, the effects of the deeds of men, for good orfor evil, remain. And their words remain, the distillation of theirthought and experience. This we know, and we know, moreover, that “onething at least is certain,” not that “this life dies”--for that has yetto be proved--but that “the race lives!” Nature is so careless aboutthe individual life, so careful for the species, that it seems as ifit were only the latter that counted, that her only purpose was theeternal continuation of life. And many to-day find a satisfaction fortheir cravings for immortality in the thought that they will live intheir children and so on immortally as long as their line continues.But we have a right to make greater hazards of faith than this. Mightit not be that, although nature never purposed that the individual soulshould live, man has outwitted her? He has certainly outwitted her inregard to his bodily life. There was no provision in nature for man’sliving by tillage of the soil and domestication of animals, or for hisdwelling in houses built with tools in his hands, or for travelingat lightning speed, or for harnessing her forces to run for him themachines that should turn out the luxuries and utilities of life. Allthese were pure gratuities, devised by man and wrested from nature’sunwilling hands. She was satisfied with primitive, animal-like man,as she is satisfied with him in some parts of the world to-day. Wehave simply got ahead of her. All the other animals are still underher dominion, but man has become the tool-maker and the partial masterof nature herself. Although still far from thoroughly taming her, hefinds in the incessant struggle his real life purpose, his inspiration,and his work, and still brighter promises for his children’s children.For the race lives and takes advantage of all that has been discoveredbefore.Now, since nature has seemed to care as little about the continuationof life beyond death as she has of man’s comfort upon earth, mightit not be that, just as we have outwitted her in the physical sphereand snatched comfort and utility by our efforts, so we may, by thecultivation of our intelligence and sentiments and whole spirituallife, outwit her in this realm and snatch an immortality that she hasnever contemplated? She never intended that we should audaciously readher secrets and speculate upon her nature as we have done. Who knowswhether, by our hardihood in exploring the uncharted seas of the lifeof feeling and thought, we may have over-reached her again and createda real soul, which we can project beyond death? We are provided withthe raw material of our spiritual life in the world, as we are providedwith the raw material to build houses, and it may be our power andour privilege to build our immortal souls here on earth, as men havebuilt and are still building the civilization of this world of ours.This would not mean that we could all attain, any more than that allmen have the creative genius or the good-will for the constructivework of civilization; there may be “real losses and real losers” inthe adventure for immortality, but to the stout-hearted and the wiseit will be possible. We shall need, as builders need the rules of thecraft, the aid and counsel of the spiritually gifted who have gonebefore us. It has been no mistake that we have prized them highereven than our material builders, for we have felt instinctively thespiritual power with which they have endowed us in the contest for themighty stake of immortality. They are helping us to it, and we have theright to rely on their visions and trusts and beliefs in this supremestand culminating episode of the adventure of life.Are all such speculations idle and frivolous? Have they no place onthe mental horizon of a youth of to-day, living in a world whoseinner nature all the mighty achievements of the scientists, fruitfulas they have been in their practical effects, have tended rather toobscure than to illumine? Well, a settled conviction that we live ina mechanical world, with no penumbra of mystery about us, checks thelife-enhancing powers, and chills and depresses the spirit. A beliefin the deadness of things actually seems to kill much of the glowinglife that makes up our appreciation of art and personality in theworld. The scientific philosophy is as much a matter of metaphysics, oftheoretical conjecture, as the worst fanaticisms of religion. We havea right to shoot our guesses into the unknown. Life is no adventureif we let our knowledge, still so feeble and flickering, smother us.In this scientific age there is a call for youth to soar and paint anew spiritual sky to arch over our heads. If the old poetry is dead,youth must feel and write the new poetry. It has a challenge both totranscend the physical evil that taints the earth and the materialisticpoison that numbs our spirits.The wise men thought they were getting the old world thoroughly chartedand explained. But there has been a spiritual expansion these recentyears which has created new seas to be explored and new atmospheresto breathe. It has been discovered that the world is alive, and thatdiscovery has almost taken away men’s breaths; it has been discoveredthat evolution is creative and that we are real factors in thatcreation. After exploring the heights and depths of the stars,and getting ourselves into a state of mind where we saw the worldobjectively and diminished man and his interests almost to a pin-point,we have come with a rush to the realization that personality and valuesare, after all, the important things in a living world. And no problemof life or death can be idle. A hundred years ago it was thoughtchastening to the fierce pride of youth to remind it often of man’smortality. But youth to-day must think of everything in terms of life;yes, even of death in terms of life. We need not the chastening ofpride, but the stimulation to a sense of the limitless potentialitiesof life. No thought or action that really enhances life is frivolous orfruitless.What does not conduce in some way to men’s interests does not enhancelife. What decides in the long run whether our life will be adventurousor not is the direction and the scope of our interests. We need alivelier imaginative sympathy and interest in all that pertains tohuman nature and its workings. It is a good sign that youth doesnot need to have its attention called to the worthy and profitableinterest of its own personality. It is a healthy sign that we aregetting back home again to the old endeavor of “Know thyself!” Ourwidening experience has shifted the centre of gravity too far fromman’s soul. A cultivation of the powers of one’s own personality isone of the greatest needs of life, too little realized even in theseassertive days, and the exercise of the personality makes for its mostdurable satisfactions. Men are attentive to their business affairs, butnot nearly enough to their own deeper selves. If they treated theirbusiness interests as they do the interests of their personality, theywould be bankrupt within a week. Few people even scratch the surface,much less exhaust the contemplation, of their own experience. Few knowhow to weave a philosophy of life out of it, that most precious of allpossessions. And few know how to hoard their memory. For no matter whatwe have come through, or how many perils we have safely passed, or howimperfect and jagged--in some places perhaps irreparably--our life hasbeen, we cannot in our heart of hearts imagine how it could have beendifferent. As we look back on it, it slips in behind us in orderlyarray, and, with all its mistakes, acquires a sort of eternal fitness,and even, at times, of poetic glamour.The things I did, I did because, after all, I am that sort of aperson--that is what life is;--and in spite of what others and what Imyself might desire, it is that kind of a person that I am. The goldenmoments I can take a unique and splendid satisfaction in because theyare my own; my realization of how poor and weak they might seem, iftaken from my treasure-chest and exposed to the gaze of others, doesnot taint their preciousness, for I can see them in the larger lightof my own life. Every man should realize that his life is an epic;unfortunately it usually takes the onlooker to recognize the factbefore he does himself. We should oftener read our own epics--and writethem. The world is in need of true autobiographies, told in terms ofthe adventure that life is. Not every one, it is said, possesses theliterary gift, but what, on the other hand, is the literary gift but anabsorbing interest in the personality of things, and an insight intothe wonders of living? Unfortunately it is usually only the eccentricor the distinguished who reveal their inner life. Yet the epic of thehumblest life, told in the light of its spiritual shocks and changes,would be enthralling in its interest. But the best autobiographers arestill the masters of fiction, those wizards of imaginative sympathy,who create souls and then write their spiritual history, as thosesouls themselves, were they alive, could perhaps never write them.Every man, however, can cultivate this autobiographical interest inhimself, and produce for his own private view a real epic of spiritualadventure. And life will be richer and more full of meaning as thestory continues and life accumulates.Life changes so gradually that we do not realize our progress. Thissmall triumph of yesterday we fail to recognize as the summit of themountain at whose foot we encamped several years ago in despair. Weforget our hopes and wistfulness and struggles. We do not look downfrom the summit at the valley where we started, and thus we lose thedramatic sense of something accomplished. If a man looking back seesno mountain and valley, but only a straight level plain, it behooveshim to take himself straight to some other spiritual country wherethere is opportunity for climbing and where five years hence willsee him on a higher level, breathing purer air. Most people have notrouble in remembering their rights and their wrongs, their pretensionsand their ambitions,--things so illusory that they should never evenhave been thought of. But to forget their progress, to forget theirgolden moments, their acquisitions of insight and appreciation, thecharm of their friends, the sequence of their ideals,--this is indeeda deplorable aphasia! “The days that make us happy make us wise!”Happiness is too valuable to be forgotten, and who will remember yoursif you forget it? It is what has made the best of you; or, if you havethrown it away from memory, what could have made you, and made youricher than you are. If you have neglected such contemplation, you arepoor, and that poverty will be apparent in your daily personality.Life in its essence is a heaping-up and accumulation of thought andinsight. It should mount higher and higher, and be more potent andflowering as life is lived. If you do not keep in your memory andspirit the finer accumulations of your life, it will be as if you hadonly partly lived. Your living will be a travesty on life, and yourprogress only a dull mechanical routine. Even though your life may beoutwardly routine, inwardly, as moralists have always known, it maybe full of adventure. Be happy, but not too contented. Contentmentmay be a vice as well as a virtue; too often it is a mere cover forsluggishness, and not a sign of triumph. The mind must have a certainamount of refreshment and novelty; it will not grow by staying toocomfortably at home, and refusing to put itself to the trouble oftravel and change. It needs to be disturbed every now and then to keepthe crust from forming. People do not realize this, and let themselvesbecome jaded and uninterested--and therefore uninteresting--when sucha small touch of novelty would inspire and stimulate them. A tiredinterest, in a healthy mind, wakes with as quick a response to a newtouch or aspect as does a thirsty flower to the rain. Too many peoplesit in prison with themselves until they get meagre and dull, when thedoor was really all the time open, and outside was freshness and greengrass and the warm sun, which might have revived them and made thembright again. Listlessness in an old man or woman is often the telltalesign of such an imprisonment. Life, instead of being an accumulationof spiritual treasure, has been the squandering of its wealth, in alapse of interest, as soon as it was earned. Even unbearable sorrowmight have been the means, by a process of transmutation, of acquiringa deeper appreciation of life’s truer values. But the squanderer haslost his vision, because he did not retain on the background of memoryhis experience, against which to contrast his new reactions, anddid not have the emotional image of old novelties to spur him to theapprehension and appreciation of new ones.More amazing even than the lack of a healthy interest in their ownpersonalities is the lack of most people of an interest, beyond oneof a trivial or professional nature, in others. Our literary artistshave scarcely begun to touch the resources of human ways and acts.Writers surrender reality for the sake of a plot, and in attempting tomake a point, or to write adventure, squeeze out the natural traitsand nuances of character and the haphazardnesses of life that are thetrue adventure and point. We cannot know too much about each other.All our best education comes from what people tell us or what weobserve them do. We cannot endure being totally separated from others,and it is well that we cannot. For it would mean that we should havethen no life above the satisfaction of our crudest material wants.Our keenest delights are based upon some manifestation or other ofsocial life. Even gossip arises not so much from malice as from a realsocial interest in our neighbors; the pity of it is, of course, thatto so many people it is only the misfortunes and oddities that areinteresting.Let our interests in the social world with which we come in contact beactive and not passive. Let us give back in return as good an influenceand as much as is given to us. Let us live so as to stimulate others,so that we call out the best powers and traits in them, and make thembetter than they are, because of our comprehension and inspiration.Our life is so bound up with our friends and teachers and heroes(whether present in the flesh or not), and we are so dependent uponthem for nourishment and support, that we are rarely aware how littleof us there would be left were they to be taken away. We are seldomconscious enough of the ground we are rooted in and the air we breathe.We can know ourselves best by knowing others. There are adventures ofpersonality in acting and being acted upon, in studying and delightingin the ideas and folkways of people that hold much in store for thosewho will only seek them.Thus in its perils and opportunities, in its satisfactions andresistances, in its gifts and responsibilities, for good or for evil,life is an adventure. In facing its evil, we shall not let it dauntor depress our spirits; we shall surrender some of our responsibilityfor the Universe, and face forward, working and encouraging thosearound us to coöperate with us and with all who suffer, in fightingpreventable wrong. Death we shall transcend by interpreting everythingin terms of life; we shall be victorious over it by recognizing in itan aspect of a larger life in which we are immersed. We shall acceptgladly the wealth of days poured out for us. Alive, in a living world,we shall cultivate those interests and qualities which enhance life.We shall try to keep the widest possible fund of interests in orderthat life may mount ever richer, and not become jaded and wearied inits ebb-flow. We shall never cease to put our questions to the heartof the world, intent on tracking down the mysteries of its behaviorand its meaning, using each morsel of knowledge to pry further intoits secrets, and testing the tools we use by the product they createand the hidden chambers they open. To face the perils and hazardsfearlessly, and absorb the satisfactions joyfully, to be curious andbrave and eager,--is to know the adventure of life.VIISOME THOUGHTS ON RELIGIONIn youth we grow and learn and always the universe widens around us.The horizon recedes faster than we can journey towards it. There comesa time when we look back with longing to the days when everything welearned seemed a fast gaining upon the powers of darkness, and each newprinciple seemed to illuminate and explain an immense region of theworld. We had only to keep on learning in steady progress, it seemed,until we should have dominion over the whole of it. But there came atime, perhaps, when advance halted, and our carefully ordered worldbegan to dissipate and loose ends and fringes to appear. It became areal struggle to keep our knowledge securely boxed in our one system,indeed, in any system, as we found when we restlessly tried one dogmaafter another as strong-boxes for our spiritual goods. Always somethingeluded us; it was “ever not quite.” Just when we were safest, somenew experience came up to be most incongruously unaccounted for.We had our goods, for instance, safely stowed away in the box of“materialism,” when suddenly we realized that, on its theory, our wholelife might run along precisely as we see it now, we might talk and loveand paint and build without a glimmer of consciousness, that wondrousstuff which is so palpably our light and our life. The materialistcan see in us nothing but the inert accompaniment of our bodies, thehelpless, useless, and even annoying spectators of the play of physicalforces through these curious compounds of chemical elements that wecall our bodies. Or if, filled with the joy of creation, we tried topack our world into the dogma of “idealism” and see all hard materialthings as emanations from our spiritual self and plastic under ourhand, we were brought with a shock against some tough, incorrigiblefact that sobered our elation, and forced the unwilling recognition ofour impotence upon us again.It is not, however, from an excess of idealism that the world suffersto-day. But it is sick rather with the thorough-going and plausiblescientific materialism with which our philosophy and literature seem toreek. Pure idealism has long ago proved too intoxicating a confirmationof our hopes and desires to seduce for long our tough-mindedness.Science has come as a challenge to both our courage and our honesty.It covertly taunts us with being afraid to face the universe as it is;if we look and are saddened, we have seemed to prove ourselves lessthan men. For this advance of scientific speculation has seemed onlyto increase the gulf between the proven and certain facts, and all thevalues and significances of life that our reactions to its richnesshave produced in us. And so incorrigibly honest is the texture of thehuman mind that we cannot continue to believe in and cultivate thingsthat we no longer consider to be real. And science has undermined ourfaith in the reality of a spiritual world that to our forefatherswas the only reality in the universe. We are so honest, however,that when the scientist relegates to a subjective shadowy realm ourworld of qualities and divinities, we cannot protest, but only lookwistfully after the disappearing forms. A numbness has stolen overour religion, art, and literature, and the younger generation finds achill and torpor in those interests of life that should be the highestinspiration.Religion in these latter days becomes poetry, about which should neverbe asked the question, “Is it true?” Art becomes a frivolous toy;literature a daily chronicle.There is thus a crucial intellectual dilemma that faces us to-day. Ifwe accept whole-heartedly the spiritual world, we seem to be false tothe imposing new knowledge of science which is rapidly making the worldcomprehensible to us; if we accept all the claims and implications ofscience, we seem to trample on our own souls. Yet we feel instinctivelythe validity of both aspects of the world. Our solution will seem tobe, then, to be content with remaining something less than monists.We must recognize that this is an infinite universe, and give up ourattempt to get all our experience under one roof. Striving ever forunity, we must yet understand that this “not-quite-ness” is one ofthe fundamental principles of things. We can no longer be satisfiedwith a settlement of the dreary conflict between religion and sciencewhich left for religion only the task of making hazardous speculationswhich science was later to verify or cast aside, as it charted the seasof knowledge. We cannot be content with a religion which science isconstantly overtaking and wiping out, as it puts its brave postulatesof faith to rigorous test.The only view of religion and science that will satisfy us is onethat makes them each the contemplation of a different aspect of theuniverse,--one, an aspect of quantities and relations, the other, anaspect of qualities, ideals, and values. They may be coördinate andcomplementary, but they are not expressible in each others’ terms.There is no question of superior reality. The blue of a flower is justas real as the ether waves which science tells us the color “really”is. Scientific and intuitive knowledge are simply different ways ofappreciating an infinite universe. Scientific knowledge, for all itsdogmatic claims to finality, is provisional and hypothetical. “Ifwe live in a certain kind of a world,” it says, “certain things aretrue.” Each fact hinges upon another. Yet these correlations of thephysical world are so certain and predictable that no sane mind candoubt them. On the other hand, our knowledge of qualities is direct andimmediate, and seems to depend on nothing for its completeness. Yet itis so uncertain and various that no two minds have precisely the samereactions, and we do not ourselves have the same reactions at differenttimes.And these paradoxes give rise to the endless disputes as to whichgives the more real view of the universe in which we find ourselvesliving. The matter-of-fact person takes the certainty and lets theimmediacy go; the poet and the mystic and the religious man choose thedirect revelation and prize this vision far above any logical cogency.Now it will be the task of this intellectual generation to conquerthe paradoxes by admitting the validity of both the matter-of-factview and the mystical. And it is the latter that requires the presentemphasis; it must be resuscitated from the low estate into which it hasfallen. We must resist the stern arrogances of science as vigorouslyas the scientist has resisted the allurements of religion. We mustremind him that his laws are not visions of eternal truth, so much asrough-and-ready statements of the practical nature of things, in sofar as they are useful to us for our grappling with our environmentand somehow changing it. We must demand that he climb down out of thepapal chair, and let his learning become what it was meant to be,--thehumble servant of humanity. Truth for truth’s sake is an admirablemotto for the philosopher, who really searches to find the inner natureof things. But the truth of science is for use’s sake. To seek forphysical truth which is irrelevant to human needs and purposes is aspurely futile an intellectual gymnastic as the logical excesses of theschoolmen. The scientist is here to tell us the practical workings ofthe forces and elements of the world; the philosopher, mystic, artist,and poet are here to tell us of the purposes and meanings of the worldas revealed directly, and to show us the ideal aspect through their ownclear fresh vision.That vision, however, must be controlled and enriched by the democraticexperience of their fellow men; their ideal must be to reveal meaningsthat cannot be doubted by the normal soul, in the same way thatscientific formulations cannot be doubted by the normal mind. It ishere that we have a quarrel with old religion and old poetry, thatthe vision which it brings us is not sufficiently purged of localdiscolorations or intellectualistic taints. But it is not a quarrelwith religion and poetry as such; this age thirsts for a revelationof the spiritual meanings of the wider world that has been opened tous, and the complex and baffling anomalies that seem to confront us.It is our imperative duty to reëmphasize the life of qualities andideals, to turn again our gaze to that aspect of the world from whichmen have always drawn what gave life real worth and reinstate thosespiritual things whose strength advancing knowledge has seemed to sap.There is room for a new idealism, but an idealism that sturdily keepsits grip on the real, that grapples with the new knowledge and with theirrevocable loss of much of the old poetry and many of the old values,and wrests out finer qualities and a nobler spiritual life than theworld has yet seen. It is not betrayal of our integrity to believe thatthe desires and interests of men, their hopes and fears and creativeimaginings, are as real as any atoms or formulas.Now the place of religion in this new idealism will be the same placethat its essential spirit has always held in the spiritual life ofmen. Religion is our sense of the quality of the universe itself, thebroadest, profoundest, and most constant of our intuitions. Men havealways felt that, outside of the qualities of concrete things, therelay a sort of infinite quality that they could identify with the spiritof the universe, and they have called it God. To this quality men havealways responded, and that response and appreciation is religion. Toappreciate this cosmic quality is to be religious, and to express thatappreciation is to worship. Religion is thus as much and eternallya part of life as our senses themselves; the only justification formaking away with religion would be an event that would make away withour senses. The scientist must always find it difficult to explain why,if man’s mind, as all agree that it did, developed in adaptation to hisenvironment, it should somehow have become adapted so perfectly to aspiritual world of qualities and poetic interpretation of phenomena,and not to the world of atomic motion and mechanical law whichscientific philosophy assures us is the “real” world. Our minds somehowadapted themselves, not to the hard world of fact, but to a world ofillusion, which had not the justification of being even practicallyuseful or empirically true. If the real world is mechanical, we shouldhave a right to expect the earliest thinking to be scientific, andthe spiritual life to come in only after centuries of refinementof thought. But the first reactions of men were of course purelyqualitative, and it is only within the last few minutes of cosmic timethat we have known of the quantitative relations of things. Is it hard,then, to believe that, since we and the world have grown up together,there must be some subtle correlation between it and the values andqualities that we feel, that our souls must reflect--not faithfully,perhaps, because warped by a thousand alien compelling physical forces,and yet somehow indomitably--a spiritual world that is perhaps evenmore real, because more immediate and constant, than the physical? Wemay partially create it, but we partially reflect it too.That cosmic quality we feel as personality. Not artificial or illusiveis this deeply rooted anthropomorphic sense which has always been atthe bottom of man’s religious consciousness. We are alive, and wehave a right to interpret the world as living; we are persons, and wehave a right to interpret the world in terms of personality. In allreligions, through the encrustations of dogma and ritual, has beenfelt that vital sense of the divine personality, keeping clean andsweet the life of man. The definite appeal of the Church, in timeslike these, when the external props fall away, is to the incarnationof the divine personality, and the ideal of character deduced from itas a pattern for life. This is the religion of ordinary people to-day;it has been the heart of Christianity for nineteen hundred years. Ourfeeling of this cosmic quality may be vague or definite, diffused orcrystallized, but to those of us who sense behind our pulsing life amystery which perplexes, sobers, and elevates us, that quality forms apermanent scenic background for our life.To feel this cosmic quality of a divine personality, in whom we live,move, and have our being, is to know religion. The ordinary world welive in is incurably dynamic; we are forced to think and act in termsof energy and change and constant rearrangement and flux of factors andelements. And we live only as we give ourselves up to that stream andplay of forces. Throughout all the change, however, there comes a senseof this eternal quality. In the persistence of our own personality,the humble fragment of a divine personality, we get the pattern of itspermanence. The Great Companion is ever with us, silently ratifyingour worthy deeds and tastes and responses. The satisfactions of ourspiritual life, of our judgments and appreciations of morality and artand any kind of excellence, come largely from this subtle corroborationthat we feel from some unseen presence wider than ourselves. Itaccompanies not a part but the whole of our spiritual life, silentlystrengthening our responses to personality and beauty, our sense ofirony, the refinement of our taste, sharpening our moral judgment,elevating our capacities for happiness, filling ever richer our senseof the worth of life. And this cosmic influence in which we seem to beimmersed we can no more lose or doubt--after we have once felt the rushof time past us, seen a friend die, or brooded on the bitter thought ofour personal death, felt the surge of forces of life and love, wonderedabout consciousness, been melted before beauty--than we can lose ordoubt ourselves. The wonder of it is exhaustless,--the beneficence overwhose workings there yet breathes an inexorable sternness, the mysteryof time and death, the joy of beauty and creative art and sex, andsheer consciousness.Against this scenic background, along this deep undercurrent offeeling, our outward, cheerful, settled, and orderly life plays itspart. That life is no less essential; we must be willing to see life intwo aspects, the world as deathless yet ever-creative, evolution yettimeless eternity. To be religious is to turn our gaze away from thedynamic to the static and the permanent, away from the stage to thescenic background of our lives. Religion cannot, therefore, be saidto have much of a place in our activity of life, except as it fixesthe general emotional tone. We have no right to demand that it operatepractically, nor can we call altruistic activity, and enthusiasm for anoble cause, religion. Moral action is really more a matter of socialpsychology than of religion. All religions have been ethical only as asecondary consideration. Religion in and for itself is something else;we can enjoy it only by taking, as it were, the moral holiday into itsregions when we are weary of the world of thinking and doing. It is aland to retreat into when we are battered and degraded by the dynamicworld about us, and require rest and recuperation. It is constantlythere behind us, but to live in it always is to take a perpetualholiday.At all times we may have its beauty with us, however, as we may haveprospects of far mountains and valleys. As we go in the morning towork in the fields, religion is this enchanting view of the mountains,inspiring us and lifting our hearts with renewed vigor. Through all thelong day’s work we feel their presence with us, and have only to turnaround to see them shining splendidly afar with hope and kindliness.Even the austerest summits are warm in the afternoon sun. Yet if wegaze at them all day long, we shall accomplish no work. Nor shall wefinish our allotted task if we succumb to their lure and leave ourfields to travel towards them. As we return home weary at night, themountains are still there to refresh and cheer us with their softcolors and outline blended in the purple light. When our task isentirely done, it has been our eternal hope to journey to those farmountains and valleys; if this is not to be, at least their gloriousview will be the last to fall upon us as we close our eyes. But we knowthat, whatever happens, if we have done our work well, have performedfaithfully our daily tasks of learning to control and manage andmake creative the tough soil of this material world in which we findourselves, if we have neither allowed its toughness to distract us fromthe beauty of the eternal background, nor let those far visions slowdown the wheels of life, distract us from our work, or blur our thoughtand pale by their light the other qualities and beauties around us--weshall attain what is right for us when we lay down our tools. In aliving world, death can be no more than an apparition.VIIITHE MYSTIC TURNED RADICALThe mystical temperament is little enough popular in this workadaymodern world of ours. The mystic, we feel, comes to us discountedfrom the start; he should in all decency make constant apologies forhis existence. In a practical age of machinery he is an anomaly, ananachronism. He must meet the direct challenge of the scientist, whoguards every approach to the doors of truth and holds the keys of itscitadel. Any thinker who gets into the fold by another way is a thiefand a robber.The mystic must answer that most heinous of all charges,--of beingunscientific. By tradition he is even hostile to science. For his maininterest is in wonder, and science by explaining things attacks thevery principle of his life. It not only diminishes his opportunitiesfor wonder, but threatens to make him superfluous by ultimatelyexplaining everything.The scientist may say that there is no necessary antithesis betweenexplanation and that beautiful romance of thought we call wonder. Thesavage, who can explain nothing, is the very creature who has no wonderat all. Everything is equally natural to him. Only a mind that hasacquaintance with laws of behavior can be surprised at events.The wonder of the scientist, however, although it be of a more robust,tough-minded variety, is none the less wonder. A growing acquaintancewith the world, an increasing at-homeness in it, is not necessarilyincompatible with an ever-increasing marvel both at the beautifulfitness of things and the limitless field of ignorance and mysterybeyond. So the modern mystic must break with his own tradition if heis to make an appeal to this generation, and must recognize that theantithesis between mystic and scientific is not an eternally valid one.It is just through realization of this fact that Maeterlinck, the bestof modern mystics, makes his extraordinary appeal. For, as he tells us,the valid mystery does not begin at the threshold of knowledge but onlyafter we have exhausted our resources of knowing. His frank and genuineacceptance of science thus works out a _modus vivendi_ between the seenand the unseen. It allows many of us who have given our allegianceto science to hail him gladly as a prophet who supplements the workof the wise men of scientific research, without doing violence to ourown consciences. For the world is, in spite of its scientific clamor,still far from ready really to surrender itself to prosaicness. It isstill haunted with the dreams of the ages--dreams of short roads totruth, visions of finding the Northwest passage to the treasures of theUnseen. Only we must go as far as possible along the traveled routes ofscience.Maeterlinck is thus not anti-scientific or pseudo-scientific, butrather sub-scientific. He speaks of delicately felt and subtleinfluences and aspects of reality that lie beneath the surface of ourlives, of forces and shadows that cannot be measured quantitativelyor turned into philosophical categories. Or we may say that heis ultra-scientific. As science plods along, opening up the darkwilderness, he goes with the exploring party, throwing a search-lightbefore them; flickering enough and exasperatingly uncertain at times,but sufficiently constant to light up the way, point out a path, andgive us confidence that the terrors before us are not so formidableas we have feared. His influence on our time is so great because webelieve that he is a seer, a man with knowledge of things hidden fromour eyes. We go to him as to a spiritual clairvoyant,--to have him tellus where to find the things our souls have lost.But the modern mystic must not only recognize the scientific aspectof the age,--he must feel the social ideal that directs the spiritualenergies of the time. It is the glory of Maeterlinck’s mysticism thatit has not lingered in the depths of the soul, but has passed out toilluminate our thinking in regard to the social life about us. Thegrowth of this duality of vision has been with him a long evolution.His early world was a shadowy, intangible thing. As we read the earlyessays, we seem to be constantly hovering on the verge of an idea, justas when we read the plays we seem to be hovering on the verge of apassion. This long brooding away from the world, however, was fruitfuland momentous. The intense gaze inward trained the eye, so that whenthe mists cleared away and revealed the palpitating social world abouthim, his insight into its meaning was as much more keen and true thanour own as had been his sense of the meaning of the individual soul.The light he turns outward to reveal the meaning of social progress isall the whiter for having burned so long within.In the essay on “Our Social Duty,” the clearest and the consummateexpression of this new outward look, there are no contaminating fringesof vague thought; all is clear white light. With the instinct of thetrue radical, the poet has gone to the root of the social attitude. Ourduty as members of society is to be radical, he tells us. And not onlythat, but an excess of radicalism is essential to the equilibrium oflife. Society so habitually thinks on a plane lower than is reasonablethat it behooves us to think and to hope on an even higher plane thanseems to be reasonable. This is the overpoweringly urgent philosophy ofradicalism. It is the beautiful courage of such words that makes themso vital an inspiration.It is the sin of the age that nobody dares to be anything to too greata degree. We may admire extremists in principle, but we take the bestof care not to imitate them ourselves. Who in America would even belikely to express himself as does Maeterlinck in this essay? Who of uswould dare follow the counsel? Of course we can plead extenuation. InEurope the best minds are thinking in terms of revolution still, whilein America our radicalism is still simply amateurish and incompetent.To many of us, then, this call of Maeterlinck’s to the highest ofradicalisms will seem irrelevant; this new social note which appearsso strongly in all his later work will seem a deterioration fromthe nobler mysticism of his earlier days. But rather should it beviewed as the fruit of matured insight. There has been no decay,no surrender. It is the same mysticism, but with the direction ofthe vision altered. This essay is the expression of the clearestvision that has yet penetrated our social confusion, the sanest andhighest ideal that has been set before progressive minds. It may bethat its utter fearlessness, its almost ascetic detachment from thematter-of-fact things of political life, its clear cold light ofconviction and penetration, may repel some whose hearts have beenwarmed by Maeterlinck’s subtle revelations of the spiritual life. Theymay reproach him because it has no direct bearings on the immediatepractical social life; it furnishes no weapon of reform, no tool withwhich to rush out and overthrow some vested abuse. But to the travelerlost in the wood the one thing needful is a pole-star to show himhis direction. The star is unapproachable, serene, cold, and lofty.But although he cannot touch it, or utilize it directly to extendhis comfort and progress, it is the most useful of all things tohim. It fills his heart with a great hope; it coördinates his aimlesswanderings and gropings, and gives meaning and purpose to his course.So a generation lost in a chaos of social change can find in theselater words of Maeterlinck a pole-star and a guide. They do for thesocial life of man what the earlier essays did for the individual. Theyendow it with values and significances that will give steadfastnessand resource to his vision as he looks out on the great world of humanprogress, and purpose and meaning to his activity as he looks aheadinto the dim world of the future.IXSEEING, WE SEE NOTIt is a mere superstition, Maeterlinck tells us in one of his beautifulessays, that there is anything irrevocable about the past. On thecontrary, we are constantly rearranging it, revising it, remaking it.For it is only in our memory that it exists, and our conception of itchanges as the loose fringes of past events are gathered up into anew meaning, or when a sudden fortune lights up a whole series in ourlives, and shows us, stretching back in orderly array and beautifulsignificance, what we had supposed in our blindness to be a sad andchaotic welter. It is no less a superstition to suppose that we havea hand in making the present. The present, like the past, is alwaysstill to be made; indeed, must wait its turn, so to speak, to be seenin its full meaning until after the past itself has been remoulded andreconstituted. It is depressing to think that we do not know our owntime, that the events we look upon have a permanent value far differentfrom the petty one that we endow them with, that they fit into alarger whole of which we see only a dim fraction--and that the leastimportant because the seed of something that shall come much laterinto full fruition. Must our short life pass away without knowledgeor vision of the majestic processes which are unfolding themselvesunder our very eyes, while we have wasted our admiration and distortedour purpose by striving to interpret the ephemeral, that is gone assoon as we? Even the wisest among us can see with but a dim eye intothe future, and make rather a lucky guess at its potentialities thana true prophecy based on a realization of the real tendencies of thetime. It is only the Past that we really make. And this may accountfor our love of it. This fragile thing of tradition that we haveso carefully constructed and so lovingly beautified, this artisticcreation of a whole people or race, becomes most naturally the objectof our tenderest solicitude. Any attack upon it that suggests a marringof its golden beauty, any new proposal that threatens to render itsuperfluous, elicits the outraged cry of anger, the passionate defense,of the mother protecting her child. For the Past is really the childof the Present. We are the authors of its being, and upon it we lavishall our thoughts, our interest and our delight. And even our hopesare centred in the Past, for the most enthusiastic among us can do nomore than hope that something worth while will come out of the Pastto nourish us in the approaching Present. Concern for the Future isso new a thing in human history that we are hardly yet at home withthe feeling. Perhaps, if we thought more about what was before us, weshould come to know more about it. Meanwhile our only consolation isthat if _we_ cannot see, neither did the generations that were beforeus. And we have the advantage of _knowing_ that we do not see, whilethey did not care about their ignorance at all.We have constantly to check ourselves in reading history with theremembrance that, to the actors in the drama, events appeared verydifferently from the way they appear to us. We know what they weredoing far better than they knew themselves. We are in the position ofthe novel reader who looks, before he begins to read, to see how theplot turns out. This orderly and dramatic chronicle of history thatthrills us as we read has only been orderly and dramatic to readers ofthe present time, who can see the _dénouement_ of the story. History ispeculiarly the creation of the present. Even the great men of the pastare largely the agglomerations of centuries of hero-worship. Genius isas much a slow accretion of the ages as an endowment of man. Few greatpoets were seen in the full glory of their superhuman capacity by theirfellows. Contemporary opinion of the great has been complimentary butseldom excessively laudatory, and there are sad instances of the decayand deflation of a supernatural personality through the smooth, gentle,imperceptibly creeping oblivion of the centuries.We rarely see what is distinctive in our own time. The city buildersof the West are quite unconscious of the fact that they are leavingbehind them imperishable and mighty memorials of themselves. Few of thethings that we admire now will be considered by posterity as noteworthyand distinctive of our age. All depends on the vitality of our customsand social habits, and some show as high a mortality as others doa stubborn tenacity of life. What we are witnessing is a giganticstruggle of customs and ideas to survive and propagate their kind.The means of subsistence is limited; it is impossible that all shouldbe able to live. The fascinating problem for the social philosopheris which of these beliefs and tendencies will prove strong enough toovercome their rivals and make their stock a permanent type. How manyof the fads and brilliant theories and new habits of thought and tastewill be able to maintain their place in the world? If we could discernthem, we should know the distinction of our age. Definite epochs ofthe past we distinguish and celebrate because they contained the germsof ideas or the roots of institutions that still survive among us,or customs and habits of thought that flourished in them with greatbrilliancy but have now utterly passed away. Now these beginnings arequite too subtle for us to see in our contemporary life, and thereare so many brilliancies that it is impossible to pick out with anydefiniteness the things which have power to project themselves intothe future, and cast a broad trail of light back to our age. Most ofthose very things that seem to us imperishable will be the ones tofade,--fade, indeed, so gradually that they will not even be missed. Itis this gradual disappearance that gives the most thorough oblivion.History remembers only the brilliant failures and the brilliantsuccesses.We are fond of calling this an age of transition, but if we tracehistory back we find that practically every age--at least formany centuries--has been an age of transition. If we must set astarting-point from which we have been moving, the social philosopherwill be inclined to place it about the beginning of the sixteenthcentury. If we have been in transition for four hundred years, itseems almost time to settle down from this wild ferment of beliefsand discoveries that has kept the world’s mind in constant turmoilsince the time of the Renaissance. There are signs that such acrystallization is taking place. We are weeding out our culture, andcasting aside the classical literature that was the breeding-ground forthe old ideas. We have achieved as yet little to take its place. Mostof the modern literature is rather a restless groping about in the darkfor new modes of thinking and new principles of life, and thus far ithardly seems to have grasped the robust and vital in the new to anyappreciable extent. One can hardly believe that this morbid virus thatis still working with undiminished vigor and deadly effect will succeedin making itself the dominant note in European literature for the nextfive hundred years. One hates to think that our posterity is to bedoomed to torture itself into appreciating our feverish modern art andmusic, and learn to rank the wild complexities of Strauss with thesublimities of Beethoven. Shall we be sure that the conquest of the airis finally achieved and a third dimension added to man’s traveling, oris it all simply another daring and brilliant stab at the impossible,another of those blasphemies against nature which impious man isconstantly striving to commit? There are few signs of the SocialisticState, but who knows what births of new institutions, of which we arenow quite unaware, future ages will see to have been developing in ourvery midst? Is religion doomed, or is it merely being transformed, sothat we shall be seen to have been creating amid all our indifference anew type and a new ideal? Will our age actually be distinctive as theera of the Dawn of Peace, or will the baby institution of arbitrationdisappear before a crude and terrible reality? Are we progressing, orshall we seem to have sown the seeds of world decay in this age ofours, and at a great crisis in history let slip another opportunityto carry mankind to a higher social level? It is maddening to thephilosopher to think how long he will have to live to find an answerto these questions. He wants to know, but in the present all he can dois to guess at random. Not immortality, but an opportunity to wake upevery hundred years or so to see how the world is progressing, may wellbe his desire and his dream. Such an immortality may be incredible, butit is the only form which has ever proved satisfactory, or ever will,to the rational man.XTHE EXPERIMENTAL LIFEIt is good to be reasonable, but too much rationality puts the soulat odds with life. For rationality implies an almost superstitiousreliance on logical proofs and logical motives, and it is logic thatlife mocks and contradicts at every turn. The most annoying peoplein the world are those who demand reasons for everything, and themost discouraging are those who map out ahead of them long courses ofaction, plan their lives, and systematically in the smallest detailof their activity adapt means to ends. Now the difficulty with allthe prudential virtues is that they imply a world that is too good tobe true. It would be pleasant to have a world where cause and effectinterlocked, where we could see the future, where virtue had itsreward, and our characters and relations with other people and the workwe wish to do could be planned out with the same certainty with whichcooks plan a meal. But we know that that is not the kind of a worldwe actually live in. Perhaps men have thought that, by cultivatingthe rational virtues and laying emphasis on prudence and forethought,they could bend the stubborn constitution of things to meet theirideals. It has always been the fashion to insist, in spite of all theevidence, that the world was in reality a rational place where certainimmutable moral principles could be laid down with the same certaintyof working that physical laws possess. It has always been representedthat the correct procedure of the moral life was to choose one’s endor desire, to select carefully all the means by which that end couldbe realized, and then, by the use of the dogged motive force of thewill, to push through the plans to completion. In the homilies onsuccess, it has always been implied that strength of will was the onlyrequisite. Success became merely a matter of the ratio between thequantity of effort and will-power applied, and the number of obstaclesto be met. If one failed, it was because the proper amount of efforthad not been applied, or because the plans had not been properlyconstructed. The remedy was automatically to increase the effort orrationalize the plans. Life was considered to be a battle, the strategyof which a general might lay out beforehand, an engagement in which hemight plan and anticipate to the minutest detail the movement of hisforces and the disposition of the enemy. But one does not have to livevery long to see that this belief in the power and the desirabilityof controlling things is an illusion. Life works in a series ofsurprises. One’s powers are given in order that one may be alert andready, resourceful and keen. The interest of life lies largely in itsadventurousness, and not in its susceptibility to orderly mapping.The enemy rarely comes up from the side the general has expected; thebattle is usually fought out on vastly different lines from those thathave been carefully foreseen and rationally organized. And similarly inlife do complex forces utterly confound and baffle our best laid plans.Our strategy, unless it is open to instant correction, unless it isflexible, and capable of infinite resource and modification, is ahandicap rather than an aid in the battle of life. In spite of theveracious accounts of youths hewing their way to success as captainsof industry or statesmen, with their eye singly set on a steadfastpurpose, we may be sure that life seldom works that way. It is not sotractable and docile, even to the strongest. The rational ideal isone of those great moral hypocrisies which every one preaches and noone practices, but which we all believe with superstitious reverence,and which we take care shall be proven erroneous by no stubborn factsof life. Better that the facts should be altered than that the moraltradition should die!One of its evil effects is the compressing influence it has on many ofus. Recognizing that for us the world is an irrational place, we arewilling to go on believing that there are at least some gifted beingswho are proving the truth and vindicating the eternal laws of reason.We join willingly the self-stigmatized ranks of the incompetent and arecontent to shine feebly in the reflected light of those whose masterwills and power of effort have brought them through in rational triumphto their ends. The younger generation is coming very seriously to doubtboth the practicability and worth of this rational ideal. They do notfind that the complex affairs of either the world or the soul workaccording to laws of reason. The individual as a member of society isat the mercy of great social laws that regulate his fortune for him,construct for him his philosophy of life, and dictate to him his waysof making a living. As an individual soul, he is the creature ofimpulses and instincts which he does not create and which seem to liequite outside the reach of his rational will. Looked at from this largesocial viewpoint, his will appears a puny affair indeed. There seemslittle room left in which to operate, either in the sphere of societyor in his own spiritual life. That little of free-will, however, whichthere is, serves for our human purposes. It must be our care simplythat we direct it wisely; and the rational ideal is not the wisest wayof directing it. The place of our free will in the scheme of life isnot to furnish driving, but _directing_ power. The engineer could nevercreate the power that drives his engine, but he can direct it into thechannels where it will be useful and creative. The superstition of thestrong will has been almost like an attempt to create power, somethingthe soul could never do. The rational ideal has too often been a merechallenge to attain the unattainable. It has ended in futility orfailure.This superstition comes largely from our incorrigible habit of lookingback over the past, and putting purpose into it. The great man lookingback over his career, over his ascent from the humble level of hisboyhood to his present power and riches, imagines that that idealsuccess was in his mind from his earliest years. He sees a progress,which was really the happy seizing of fortunate opportunities, asthe carrying-out of a fixed purpose. But the purpose was not thereat the beginning; it is the crowning touch added to the picture,which completes and satisfies our age-long hunger for the orderly andcorrect. But we all, rich and poor, successful and unsuccessful, livefrom hand to mouth. We all alike find life at the beginning a crudemass of puzzling possibilities. All of us, unless we inherit a place inthe world,--and then we are only half alive,--have the same precariousstruggle to get a foothold. The difference is in the fortune of thefoothold, and not in our private creation of any mystical force ofwill. It is a question of happy occasions of exposure to the rightstimulus that will develop our powers at the right time. The capacityalone is sterile; it needs the stimulus to fertilize it and produceactivity and success. The part that our free will can play is to exposeourselves consciously to the stimulus; it cannot create it or thecapacity, but it can bring them together.In other words, for the rational ideal we must substitute theexperimental ideal. Life is not a campaign of battle, but a laboratorywhere its possibilities for the enhancement of happiness and therealization of ideals are to be tested and observed. We are not tostart life with a code of its laws in our pocket, with its principlesof activity already learned by heart, but we are to discover thoseprinciples as we go, by conscientious experiment. Even those laws thatseem incontrovertible we are to test for ourselves, to see whether theyare thoroughly vital to our own experience and our own genius. We areanimals, and our education in life is, after all, different only indegree, and not in kind, from that of the monkey who learns the trickof opening his cage. To get out of his cage, the monkey must findand open a somewhat complicated latch. How does he set about it? Heblunders around for a long time, without method or purpose, but withthe waste of an enormous amount of energy. At length he accidentallystrikes the right catch, and the door flies open. Our procedure inyouth is little different. We feel a vague desire to expand, to get outof our cage, and liberate our dimly felt powers. We blunder around fora time, until we accidentally put ourselves in a situation where somecapacity is touched, some latent energy liberated, and the directionset for us, along which we have only to move to be free and successful.We will be hardly human if we do not look back on the process andcongratulate ourselves on our tenacity and purpose and strong will. Butof course the thing was wholly irrational. There were neither plans norpurposes, perhaps not even discoverable effort. For when we found thework that we did best, we found also that we did it easiest. And theoutlines of the most dazzling career are little different. Until habitswere formed or prestige acquired which could float these successfulgeniuses, their life was but the resourceful seizing of opportunity,the utilization, with a minimum of purpose or effort, of the promise ofthe passing moment. They were living the experimental life, aided bygood fortune and opportunity.Now the youth brought up to the strictly rational ideal is like theanimal who tries to get out of his cage by going straight through thebars. The duck, beating his wings against his cage, is a symbol ofthe highest rationality. His logic is plain, simple, and direct. Heis in the cage; there is the free world outside; nothing but the barsseparate them. The problem is simply to fortify his will and effortand make them so strong that they will overcome the resistance of thecage. His error evidently lies not in his method, but in his estimationof the strength of the bars. But youth is no wiser; it has no dataupon which to estimate either its own strength or the strength ofits obstacles. It counts on getting out through its own self-reliantstrength and will. Like the duck, “impossible” is a word not found inits vocabulary. And like the duck, it too often dashes out its spiritagainst the bars of circumstance. How often do we see young people,brought up with the old philosophy that nothing was withheld from thosewho wanted and worked for things with sufficient determination, beatingtheir ineffectual wings against their bars, when perhaps in anotherdirection the door stands open that would lead to freedom!We do not hear enough of the tragedies of misplaced ambition. When theplans of the man of will and determination fail, and the inexorableforces of life twist his purposes aside from their end, he is sureto suffer the prostration of failure. His humiliation, too, is inproportion to the very strength of his will. It is the burden ofdefeat, or at best the sting of petty success, that crushes men, andcrushes them all the more thoroughly if they have been brought up tobelieve in the essential rationality of the world and the power of willand purpose. It is not that they have aimed too high, but that theyhave aimed in the wrong direction. They have not set out experimentallyto find the work to which their powers were adapted, they did not testcoolly and impartially the direction in which their achievement lay.They forgot that, though faith may remove mountains, the will alone isnot able. There is an urgency on every man to develop his powers tothe fullest capacity, but he is not called upon to develop those thathe does not possess. The will cannot create talent or opportunity. Thewise man is he who has the clear vision to discern the one, and thecalm patience to await the other. Will, without humor and irony and aluminous knowledge of one’s self, is likely to drive one to dash one’sbrains out against a stone wall. The world is too full of people withnothing except a will. The mistake of youth is to believe that thephilosophy of experimentation is enervating. They want to attack lifefrontally, to win by the boldness of their attack, or by the exceedingexcellence of their rational plans and purposes. But therein comes atime when they learn perhaps that it is better to take life not withtheir naked fists, but more scientifically,--to stand with mind andsoul alert, ceaselessly testing and criticizing, taking and rejecting,poised for opportunity, and sensitive to all good influences.The experimental life does not put one at the mercy of chance. It israther the rational mind that is constantly being shocked and derangedby circumstances. But the dice of the experimenter are always loaded.For he does not go into an enterprise, spiritual or material, relyingsimply on his reason and will to pull him through. He asks himselfbeforehand whether something good is not sure to come whichever waythe dice fall, or at least whether he can bear the event of failure,whether his spirit can stand it if the experiment ends in humiliationand barrenness. It is surprising how many seeming disasters one findsone can bear in this anticipatory look; the tension of the failure isrelieved, anyhow. By looking ahead, one has insured one’s self up tothe limit of the venture, and one cannot lose. But to the man with thecarefully planned campaign, every step is crucial. If all does not turnout exactly as he intends, he is ruined. He thinks he insures himselfby the excellence of his designs and the craftiness of his skill. Buthe insures himself by the strange method of putting all his eggs in onebasket. He thinks, of course, he has arranged his plans so that, ifthey fall, the universe falls with them. But when the basket breaks,and the universe does not fall, his ruin is complete.Ambition and the rational ideal seem to be only disastrous; ifunsuccessful, they produce misanthropists; if successful, beings thatprey upon their fellow men. Too much rationality makes a man mercenaryand calculating. He has too much at stake in everything he does toknow that calm disinterestedness of spirit which is the mark of theexperimental attitude towards life. Our attitude towards our personalaffairs, material and spiritual, should be like the interest we takein sports and games. The sporting interest is one secret of a healthyattitude towards life. The detached enthusiasm it creates is a realingredient of happiness. The trouble with the rational man is thathe has bet on the game. If his side wins, there is a personal rewardfor him; if it loses, he himself suffers a loss. He cannot know thetrue sporting interest which is unaffected by considerations of theend, and views the game as the thing, and not the outcome. To theexperimental attitude, failure means nothing beyond a shade of regretor chagrin. Whether we win or lose, something has been learned, someinsight and appreciation of the workings of others or of ourselves. Weare ready and eager to begin another game; defeat has not dampened ourenthusiasm. But if the man who has made the wager loses, he has lost,too, all heart for playing. Or, if he does try again, it is not forinterest in the game, but with a redoubled intensity of self-interestto win back what he has lost. With the sporting interest, one looks onone’s relations with others, on one’s little rôle in the world, in thesame spirit that we look on a political contest, where we are immenselystirred by the clash of issues and personalities, but where we knowthat the country will run on in about the same way, whoever is elected.This knowledge does not work against our interest in the struggleitself, nor in the outcome. It only insures us against defeat. It makeslife livable by endowing us with disinterestedness. If we lose, why,better luck next time, or, at worst, is not losing a part of life?The experimenter with life, then, must go into his laboratory with themind of the scientist. He has nothing at stake except the discoveryof the truth, and he is willing to work carefully and methodicallyand even cold-bloodedly in eliciting it from the tangled skein ofphenomena. But it is exactly in this cheerful, matter-of-fact way thatwe are never willing to examine our own personalities and ideas. Wetake ourselves too seriously, and handle our tastes and enthusiasmsas gingerly as if we feared they would shrivel away at the touch. Weperpetually either underestimate or overestimate our powers and worth,and suffer such losses on account of the one and humiliations onaccount of the other, as serve to unbalance our knowledge of ourselves,and discourage attempts to find real guiding principles of our own orothers’ actions. We need this objective attitude of the scientist.We must be self-conscious with a detached self-consciousness,treating ourselves as we treat others, experimenting to discover ourpossibilities and traits, testing ourselves with situations, andgradually building up a body of law and doctrine for ourselves, a realmorality that will have far more worth and power and virtue than allthat has been tried and tested before by no matter how much of alienhuman experience. We must start our quest with no prepossessions,with no theory of what ought to happen when we expose ourselves tocertain stimuli. It is our business to see what does happen, and thenact accordingly. If the electrical experimenter started with a theorythat like magnetic poles attract each other, he would be shocked todiscover that they actually repelled each other. He might even set itdown to some inherent depravity of matter. But if his theory was nota prejudice but a hypothesis, he would find it possible to revise itquickly when he saw how the poles actually behaved. And he would notfeel any particular chagrin or humiliation.But we usually find it so hard to revise our theories about ourselvesand each other. We hold them as prejudices and not as hypotheses, andwhen the facts of life seem to disprove them, we either angrily clutchat our theories and snarl in defiance, or we pull them out of us withsuch a wrench that they draw blood. The scientist’s way is to startwith a hypothesis and then to proceed to verify it by experiment.Similarly ought we to approach life and test all our hypotheses byexperience. Our methods have been too rigid. We have started withmoral dogmas, and when life obstinately refused to ratify them, wehave railed at it, questioned its sincerity, instead of adopting somenew hypothesis, which more nearly fitted our experience, and testingit until we hit on the principle which explained our workings toourselves. The common-sense, rule-of-thumb morality which has come downto us is no more valid than the common-sense, scientific observationthat the sun goes round the earth. We can rely no longer on the loosegleanings of homely proverb and common sense for our knowledge ofpersonality and human nature and life.If we do not adopt the experimental life, we are still in bondage toconvention. To learn of life from others’ words is like learning tobuild a steam-engine from books in the class-room. We may learn ofprinciples in the spiritual life that have proven true for millionsof men, but even these we must test to see if they hold true for ourindividual world. We can never attain any self-reliant morality if weallow ourselves to be hypnotized by fixed ideas of what is good orbad. No matter how good our principles, our devotion to morality willbe mere lip-service unless each belief is individually tested, and itspower to work vitally in our lives demonstrated.But this moral experimentation is not the mere mechanical repetition ofthe elementary student in the laboratory, who makes simple experimentswhich are sure to come out as the law predicts. The laws of personalityand life are far more complex, and each experiment discovers somethingreally novel and unique. The spiritual world is ever-creative; the sameexperiments may turn out differently for different experimenters, andyet they may both be right. In the spiritual experimental life, we musthave the attitude of the scientist, but we are able to surpass him indaring and boldness. We can be certain of a physical law that as it hasworked in the past, so it will work in the future. But of a spirituallaw we have no such guarantee. This it is that gives the zest ofperpetual adventure to the moral life. Human nature is an exhaustlessfield for investigation and experiment. It is inexhaustible in itsrichness and variety.The old rigid morality, with its emphasis on the prudential virtues,neglected the fundamental fact of our irrationality. It believedthat if we only knew what was good, we would do it. It was thereforesatisfied with telling us what was good, and expecting us automaticallyto do it. But there was a hiatus somewhere. For we do not do what wewant to, but what is easiest and most natural for us to do, and ifit is easy for us to do the wrong thing, it is that that we will do.We are creatures of instincts and impulses that we do not set going.And education has never taught us more than very imperfectly how totrain these impulses in accordance with our worthy desires. Instead ofendeavoring to cure this irrationality by directing our energy into thechannel of experimentation, it has worked along the lines of greatestresistance, and held up an ideal of inhibition and restraint. We havebeen alternately exhorted to stifle our bad impulses, and to strainand struggle to make good our worthy purposes and ambitions. Now theirrational man is certainly a slave to his impulses, but is not therational man a slave to his motives and reasons? The rational ideal hasmade directly for inflexibility of character, a deadening conservatismthat is unable to adapt itself to situations, or make allowance for thechanges and ironies of life. It has riveted the moral life to logic,when it should have been yoked up with sympathy. The logic of the heartis usually better than the logic of the head, and the consistency ofsympathy is superior as a rule for life to the consistency of theintellect.Life is a laboratory to work out experiments in living. That samefreedom which we demand for ourselves, we must grant to every one.Instead of falling with our spite upon those who vary from the textbookrules of life, we must look upon their acts as new and very interestinghypotheses to be duly tested and judged by the way they work whencarried out into action. Nonconformity, instead of being irritatingand suspicious, as it is now to us, will be distinctly pleasurable,as affording more material for our understanding of life and ourformulation of its satisfying philosophy. The world has never favoredthe experimental life. It despises poets, fanatics, prophets, andlovers. It admires physical courage, but it has small use for moralcourage. Yet it has always been those who experimented with life,who formed their philosophy of life as a crystallization out of thatexperimenting, who were the light and life of the world. Causes haveonly finally triumphed when the rational “gradual progress” men havebeen overwhelmed. Better crude irrationality than the rationality thatchecks hope and stifles faith.In place, then, of the rational or the irrational life, we preachthe experimental life. There is much chance in the world, but thereis also a modicum of free will, and it is this modicum that weexploit to direct our energies. Recognizing the precariousness andhaphazardness of life, we can yet generalize out of our experiencecertain probabilities and satisfactions that will serve us as wellas scientific laws. Only they must be flexible and they must betested. Life is not a rich province to conquer by our will, or towring enjoyment out of with our appetites, nor is it a market wherewe pay our money over the counter and receive the goods we desire. Itis rather a great tract of spiritual soil, which we can cultivate ormisuse. With certain restrictions, we have the choice of the cropswhich we can grow. Our duty is evidently to experiment until we findthose which grow most favorably and profitably, to vary our cropsaccording to the quality of the soil, to protect them against prowlinganimals, to keep the ground clear of noxious weeds. Contending againstwind and weather and pests, we can yet with skill and vigilance win aliving for ourselves. None can cultivate this garden of our personalitybut ourselves. Others may supply the seed; it is we who must plough andreap. We are owners in fee simple, and we cannot lease. None can livemy life but myself. And the life that I live depends on my courage,skill, and wisdom in experimentation.XITHE DODGING OF PRESSURESFor a truly sincere life one talent is needed,--the ability to steerclear of the forces that would warp and conventionalize and harden thepersonality and its own free choices and bents. All the kingdoms ofthis world lie waiting to claim the allegiance of the youth who enterson the career of life, and sentinels and guards stand ready to fetterand enslave him the moment he steps unwarily over the wall out of thefree open road of his own individuality. And unless he dodges themand keeps straight on his path, dusty and barren though it may be, hewill find himself chained a prisoner for life, and little by littlehis own soul will rot out of him and vanish. The wise men of the pasthave often preached the duty of this open road, they have summonedyouth to self-reliance, but they have not paid sufficient heed to theenemies that would impede his progress. They have been too intent onencouraging him to be independent and lead his own life, to point outto him the direction from which the subtle influences that mightcontrol him would come. As a result, young men have too often believedthat they were hewing out a career for themselves when they were reallysimply offering themselves up to some institutional Moloch to bedestroyed, or, at the best, passively allowing the career or professionthey had adopted to mould and carve them. Instead of working out theirown destiny, they were actually allowing an alien destiny to work themout. Youth enters the big world of acting and thinking, a huge bundleof susceptibilities, keenly alive and plastic, and so eager to achieveand perform that it will accept almost the first opportunity that comesto it. Now each youth has his own unique personality and interweavingweb of tendencies and inclinations, such as no other person has everhad before. It is essential that these trends and abilities be sostimulated by experience that they shall be developed to their highestcapacity. And they can usually be depended upon, if freedom andopportunity are given, to grow of themselves upward towards the sun andair. If a youth does not develop, it is usually because his nature hasbeen blocked and thwarted by the social pressures to which every one ofus is subjected, and which only a few have the strength or the wisdomto resist. These pressures come often in the guise of good fortune,and the youth meets them halfway, goes with them gladly, and lets themcrush him. He will do it all, too, with so easy a conscience, for isnot this meeting the world and making it one’s own? It is meeting theworld, but it is too often only to have the world make the youth itsown.Our spiritual guides and leaders, then, have been too positive, tooheartening, if such a thing be possible. They have either not seen thedangers that lurked in the path, or they have not cared to discourageand depress us by pointing them out. Many of our modern guides, intheir panegyrics on success, even glorify as aids on the journey thesevery dangers themselves, and urge the youth to rely upon them, when heshould have been warned not to gaze at all on the dazzling lure. Theyouth is urged to imitate men who are themselves victims of the veryinfluences that he should dodge, and doctrines and habits are pressedupon him which he should ceaselessly question and never once make hisown unless he is sure that they fit him. He will have need to be everalert to the dangers, and, in early youth at least, would better thinkmore of dodging them than of attaining the goal to which his elderstempt him. Their best service to him would be to warn him againstthemselves and their influence, rather than to encourage him to becomelike them.The dangers that I speak of are the influences and inducements whichcome to youth from family, business, church, society, state, tocompromise with himself and become in more or less degree conformedto their pattern and type. “Be like us!” they all cry, “it is easiestand safest thus! We guarantee you popularity and fortune at so smalla price,--only the price of your best self!” Thus they seduce himinsidiously rather than openly attack him. They throw their silkychains over him and draw him in. Or they press gently but ceaselesslyupon him, rubbing away his original roughness, polishing him down,moulding him relentlessly, and yet with how kindly and solicitous atouch, to their shape and manner. As he feels their caressing pressureagainst him in the darkness, small wonder is it that he mistakes it forthe warm touch of friends and guides. They are friends and guides whoalways end, however, by being masters and tyrants. They force him toperpetuate old errors, to keep alive dying customs, to breathe new lifeinto vicious prejudices, to take his stand against the saving new.They kill his soul, and then use the carcass as a barricade against theadvancing hosts of light. They train him to protect and conserve theirown outworn institutions when he should be the first, by reason of hisclear insight and freedom from crusted prejudice, to attack them.The youth’s only salvation lies, then, in dodging these pressures. Itis not his business to make his own way in life so much as it is toprevent some one else from making it for him. His business is to keepthe way clear, and the sky open above his head. Then he will grow andbe nurtured according to his needs and his inner nature. He must fightconstantly to keep from his head those coverings that institutionsand persons in the guise of making him warm and safe throw over hisbody. If young people would spend half the time in warding away theunfavorable influences that they now spend in conscientiously planningwhat they are going to be, they would achieve success and maintaintheir individuality. It seems, curiously enough, that one can liveone’s true life and guarantee one’s individuality best in this indirectway,--not by projecting one’s self out upon the world aggressively,but by keeping the track clear along which one’s true life may run.A sane, well-rounded, original life is attained not so much by takingthought for it as by the dodging of pressures that would limit and warpits natural growth. The youth must travel the straight road serenely,confident that “his own will come to him.” All he must strive for isto recognize his own when it does come, and to absorb and assimilateit. His imagination must be large enough to envisage himself and hisown needs. This wisdom, however, comes to too many of us only afterwe are hopelessly compromised, after we are encrusted over so deeplythat, even if we try to break away, our struggles are at the expenseof our growth. The first duty of self-conscious youth is to dodge thepressures, his second to survey the world eagerly to see what is “hisown.” If he goes boldly ahead at first to seek his own, without firstmaking provision for silencing the voices that whisper continually athis side, “Conform!”--he will soon find himself on alien ground, and,if not a prisoner, a naturalized citizen before he has time to think.Nor is this a mere invitation to whimsicality and eccentricity. Theseepithets, in our daily life, are somewhat loosely used for all sortsof behavior ranging from nonconformity to pure freakishness. If wereally had more original, unspoiled people in the world, we shouldnot use these terms so frequently. If we really had more people whowere satisfying their healthy desires, and living the life thattheir whole inner conscience told them was best, we should not findeccentric or queer the self-sustaining men and women who live withoutregard to prejudice. And all real whimsicality is a result rather ofthe thwarting of individuality than of letting it run riot. It iswhen persons of strong personality are subjected to pressures heavierthan they can bear that we get real outbursts of eccentricity. Forsomething unnatural has occurred, a spontaneous flow and progress hasbeen checked. Your eccentric man par excellence is your perfectlyconventional man, who never offends in the slightest way by anyoriginal action or thought. For he has yielded to every variety ofpressure that has been brought to bear upon him, and his originalnature has been completely obscured. The pressures have been, however,uniform on every side, so that they have seemingly canceled each other.But this equilibrium simply conceals the forces that have crushedhim. The conventional person is, therefore, not the most naturalbut the most unnatural of persons. His harmlessness is a proof ofhis tremendous eccentricity. He has been rubbed down smooth on allsides like a rock until he has dropped noiselessly into his place insociety. But at what a cost does he obtain this peace! At the cost ofdepersonalizing himself, and sacrificing his very nature, which, as inevery normal person, is precious and worthy of permanence and growth.This treason to one’s self is perhaps the greatest mistake of youth,the one unpardonable sin. It is worse than sowing one’s wild oats,for they are reaped and justice is done; or casting one’s bread uponthe waters, for that returneth after many days. But this sin is thethrowing away in willfulness or carelessness the priceless jewel ofself-hood, and with no return, either of recompense or punishment.How early and insidious is the pressure upon us to conform to sometype whose fitness we have not examined, but which we are forced totake strictly on authority! On the children in the family what apetty tyranny of ideas and manners is imposed! Under the guise ofbeing brought up, how many habits of doubtful value we learned, howmany moral opinions of doubtful significance we absorbed, how manystrange biases that harass and perplex us in our later life we hadfastened upon our minds, how many natural and beautiful tendencieswe were forced to suppress! The tyranny of manners, of conventionalpoliteness, of puritanical taboos, of superstitious religion, were allimposed upon us for no reason that our elders could devise, but simplythat they in turn had had them imposed upon them. Much of our earlyeducation was as automatic and unconscious as the handing down of theimmemorial traditions in a primitive savage tribe. Now I am far fromsaying that this household tradition of manners and morals is not anexcellent thing for us to acquire. Many of the habits are so usefulthat it is a wise provision that we should obtain them as naturally asthe air we breathe. And it is a pressure that we could not, at thatage, avoid, even if we would. But this childhood influence is a sampleof true pressure, for it is both unconscious and irresistible. Were weto infringe any of the rules laid down for us, the whole displeasure ofthe family descended upon our heads; they seemed to vie with each otherin expressing their disapproval of our conduct. So, simply to retainour self-respect, we were forced into their pattern of doing things,and for no other reason than that it was their pattern.This early pressure, however, was mild in comparison with what weexperienced as we grew older. We found then that more and more ofour actions came insensibly but in some way or other before thiscourt of appeal. We could choose our friends, for instance, only withreservations. If we consorted with little boys who were not clean, orwho came from the less reputable portions of the town, we were made tofeel the vague family disapproval, perhaps not outspoken, but as anundercurrent to their attitude. And usually we did not need flagrantlyto offend to be taught the need of judicious selection, for we weresensitive to the feeling that we knew those around us would entertain,and so avoided the objectionable people from a diffused feeling thatthey were not “nice.” When we grew old enough to move in the youthfulsocial world, we felt this circle of tyranny suddenly widen. It wasour “set” now that dictated our choices. The family pressure had beenrather subtle and uneasy; this was bold and direct. Here were the mostarbitrary selections and disqualifications, girls and boys being bannedfor no imaginable reason except that they were slightly out of theordinary, and our little world circumscribed by a rigid public opinionwhich punished nonconformity by expulsion. If we tried to dodge thispressure and assert our own privileges of making lovers and friends, wewere soon delivered an ultimatum, and if we refused to obey, we werespeedily cast out into utter darkness, where, strange to say, we lackedeven the approbation of the banned. Sometimes we were not allowed tochoose our partners to whom we paid our momentary devotions, sometimeswe were not allowed to give them up. The price we paid for freeparticipation in the parties and dances and love-affairs of this littlesocial world of youth was an almost military obedience to the generalfeeling of propriety and suitability of our relationships with others,and to the general will of those in whose circle we went. There was aptto be a rather severe code of propriety, which bore especially uponthe girls. Many frank and natural actions and expressions of opinionwere thus inhibited, from no real feeling of self-respect, but fromthe vague, uncomfortable feeling that somebody would not approve. Thisprice for society was one that we were all willing to pay, but it was abad training. Our own natural likings and dislikings got blunted; weceased to seek out our own kind of people and enjoy them and ourselvesin our own way, but we “went with” the people that our companionsthought we ought to “go with,” and we played the games and behavedgenerally as they thought we ought to do.The family rather corroborated this pressure than attempted to fortifyus in our own individuality. For their honor seemed to be involved inwhat we did, and if all our walk in life was well pleasing to thosearound us, they were well pleased with us. And all through life, aslong at least as we were protected under the sheltering wing of thefamily, its members constituted a sort of supreme court over all ourrelations in life. In resisting the other pressures that were broughtto bear on us, we rarely found that we had the family’s undividedsupport. They loved, like all social groups, a smoothly running person,and as soon as they found us doing unconventional things or havingunusual friends they were vaguely uneasy, as if they were harboringin their midst some unpredictable animal who would draw upon them thedisapproving glances of the society around them. The family philosophyhas a horror for the “queer.” The table-board is too often a placewhere the eccentricities of the world get thoroughly aired. The dreadof deviation from accepted standards is impressed upon us from ouryouth up. The threat which always brought us to terms was,--“If you dothis, you will be considered queer!” There was very little fight leftin us after that.But the family has other formidable weapons for bringing us to terms.It knows us through and through as none of our friends and enemies knowus. It sees us in undress, when all our outward decorations of spiritand shams and pretenses are thrown off, and it is not deceived by theapologies and excuses that pass muster in the world at large and evento our own conscience. We can conceal nothing from it; it knows allour weakest spots and vulnerable feelings. It does not hesitate totake shameless advantage of that knowledge. Its most powerful weaponis ridicule. It can adopt no subtler method, for we in our turn knowall its own vulnerabilities. And where the world at large is generallytoo polite to employ ridicule upon us, but works with gentler methodsof approbation and coldness, our family associates feel no suchcompunction. Knowing us as they do, they are able to make that ridiculetell. We may have longings for freedom and individuality, but it is aterrible dilemma that faces us. Most men would rather be slaves thanbutts; they would rather be corralled with the herd than endure itstaunts at their independence.Besides the pressure on a youth or girl to think the way the familydoes, there is often the pressure brought upon them to sacrificethemselves for its benefit. I do not mean to deprecate that perfectlynatural and proper desire to make some return for the care and kindnessthat have been lavished upon them. But the family insistence often goesmuch further than this. It demands not only that its young people shallrecompense it for what it has done for them, but that they do it in thekind of work and vocation that shall seem proper to it. How often, whenthe youth or girl is on the point of choosing a congenial occupationor profession, does the family council step in and, with the utmostapparent good-will in the world, dictate differently! And too often themotives are really policy or ambition, or, at best, sheer prejudice.If the youth be not persuaded, then he must bear the brunt of lonelytoil without the sympathy or support of those most dear to him. Farharder is the lot of the young woman. For there is still so muchprejudice against a girl’s performing useful work in society, apartfrom her God-given duty of getting married, that her initiative iscrushed at the very beginning. The need of cultivating some particulartalent or interest, even if she has not to earn her living, seems to beseldom felt. Yet women, with their narrower life, have a greater needof sane and vigorous spiritual habits than do men. It is imperativethat a girl be prevented from growing up into a useless, fleshly, andtrivial woman, of the type one sees so much of nowadays. Even if agirl does marry, a few intellectual interests and gifts and tasteswill not be found to detract from her charm or usefulness. The worldnever needed so much as it does to-day women of large hearts and largeminds, whose home and sphere are capable of embracing something beyondthe four corners of their kitchen. And the world can get such womenonly by allowing them the initiative and opportunity to acquire variedinterests and qualities while they are young.The family often forges sentimental bonds to keep it living togetherlong after the motive and desire have departed. There is no group souncongenial as an uncongenial family. The constant rubbing togetheraccentuates all the divergencies and misunderstandings. Yet sometimesa family whose members are hopelessly mismated will cling togetherthrough sheer inertia or through a conscientious feeling of duty. Andduty to too many of us is simply a stimulus to that curious love forfutile suffering that form some of the darker qualities of the puritansoul. Family duty may not only warp and mutilate many a life that wouldbloom healthily outside in another environment, but it may actuallymean the pauperization of the weaker members. The claims of membersof the family upon each other are often overwhelming, and still moreoften quite fictitious in their justice. Yet that old feeling of theindissolubility of the family will often allow the weak, who might, ifforced to shift for themselves, become strong, to suck the lifebloodfrom the stronger members. Coöperation, when it is free and spontaneousand on a basis of congeniality, is the foundation of all social lifeand progress, but forced cohesion can do little good. The averagefamily is about as well mated as any similar group would be, pickedout at random from society. And this means, where the superstitionof indissolubility is still effective, that the members share notonly all the benefits, but also all each others’ shortcomings andirritations. Family life thus not only presses upon its youth toconform to its customs and habits and to the opinions of the littlesocial world in which it lives, but also drags its youth down withits claims, and warps it by its tension of uncongeniality, checksits spontaneity by its lack of appreciation, and injures its soul byfriction and misunderstanding.This family pressure upon youth is serious, and potent for much goodand evil in his later life. It is necessary that he understand how toanalyze it without passion or prejudice, and find out just how he candodge the unfavorable pressure without injury to the love that is bornehim or the love that he bears to the others. But let him not believethat his love is best shown by submission. It is best shown by aresolute determination and assertion of his own individuality. Only hemust know, without the cavil of a doubt, what that individuality is; hemust have a real imaginative anticipation of its potentialities. Onlywith this intuition will he know where to dodge and how to dodge.It is true that the modern generation seems to be changing all this.Family cohesion and authority no longer mean what they did even twentyyears ago. The youth of to-day are willful, selfish, heartless, intheir rebellion. They are changing the system blindly and blunderingly.They feel the pressure, and without stopping to ask questions oranalyze the situation, they burst the doors and flee away. Theirseeming initiative is more animal spirits than anything else. Theyhave exploded the myth that their elders have any superhuman wisdomof experience to share with them, or any incontrovertible philosophyof life with which to guide their wandering footsteps. But it must beadmitted that most have failed so far to find a wisdom and a philosophyto take its place. They have too often thrown away the benefits offamily influence on account of mere trivialities of misunderstanding.They have not waited for the real warpings of initiative, the realpressure of prejudice, but have kicked up their heels at the firstbreath of authority. They have not so much dodged the pressure asfled it altogether. Instead of being intent on brushing away theannoying obstacles that interfered with the free growth of theirown worthier selves, they have mistaken the means for the end, andhave merely brushed off the interferences, without first having anyconsciousness of that worthier self. Now of course this is no solution.It is only as they substitute for the authority that they throw offa definite authority of their own, crystallized out of their ownideals and purposes, that they will gain or help others to gain. Forlack of a vision the people perish. For lack of a vision of their ownpersonalities, and the fresh, free, aggressive, forward, fearless,radical life that we all ought to lead, and could lead if we only hadthe imagination for it, the youth of to-day will cast off the narrowingconfining fetters of authority only to wander without any light atall. This is not to say that this aimless wandering is not better thanthe prison-house, but it is to say that the emancipation of the spiritis insufficient without a new means of spiritual livelihood to takeits place. The youth of to-day cannot rest on their liberation; theymust see their freedom as simply the setting free of forces withinthemselves for a cleaner, sincerer life, and for radical work insociety. The road is cut out before them by pioneers; they have but tolet themselves grow out in that direction.I have painted the family pressures in this somewhat lurid huebecause they are patterns of the other attacks which are made uponthe youth as he meets the world. The family is a little microcosm,a sheltered group where youth feels all those currents of influencethat sway men in their social life. Some of them are exaggerated, someperverted, but they are most of them there in that little world. Itis no new discovery that in family life one can find heaven or onecan find hell. The only pressure that is practically absent in thefamily is the economic pressure, by which I mean the inducements,and even necessities, that a youth is under of conforming to codesor customs and changing his ideals and ideas, when he comes to earnhis livelihood. This pressure affects him as soon as he looks for anopening, as he calls it, in which to make his living. At that timeall this talk of natural talents or bents or interests begin to soundfar-away and ideal. He soon finds that these things have no commercialvalue in themselves and will go but a short way towards providing himwith his living. The majority of us “go to work” as soon as our short“education” is completed, if not before, and we go not by choice,but wherever opportunity is given. Hence the ridiculous misfits, theapathy, the restlessness and discontent. The world of young peoplearound us seems too largely to be one where both men and girls areengaged in work in which they have no interest, and for which theyhave no aptitude. They are mournfully fettered to their work; all theycan seem to do is to make the best of it, and snatch out of the freemoments what pleasure and exhilaration they can. They have little hopefor a change. There is too much of a scramble for places in this busy,crowded world, to make a change anything but hazardous. It is true thatrestlessness often forces a change, but it is rarely for the better, orin the line of any natural choice or interest. One leaves one’s job,but then one takes thankfully the first job that presents itself; thelast state may be worse than the first. By this economic pressure mostof us are sidetracked, turned off from our natural path, and fastenedirrevocably to some work that we could only acquire an interest in atthe expense of our souls.It is a pressure, too, that cannot easily be dodged. We can franklyrecognize our defeat, plunge boldly at the work and make it a partof ourselves; this course of action, which most of us adopt, isreally, however, simply an unconditional surrender. We can driftalong apathetically, without interest either in our work or our ownpersonalities; this course is even more disastrous. Or we can quietlywait until we have found the vocation that guarantees the success ofour personalities; this course is an ideal that is possible to veryfew. And yet, did we but know it, a little thought at the beginningwould often have prevented the misfit, and a little boldness whenone has discovered the misfit would often have secured the favorablechange. That self-recognition, which is the only basis for a genuinespiritual success in life, is the thing that too many of us lack. Theapathy comes from a real ignorance of what our true work is. Thenwe are twice a slave,--a prey to our circumstance and a prey to ourignorance.Like all discoveries, what one’s work is can be found only byexperiment. But this can often be an imaginative experiment. One cantake an “inventory of one’s personality,” and discover one’s interests,and the kind of activity one feels at home with or takes joy in. Yetit is true that there are many qualities which cannot be discovered bythe imagination, which need the fairy touch of actual use to developthem. There is no royal road to this success. Here the obstacles areusually too thick to be dodged. We do not often enough recognize theincredible stupidity of our civilization where so much of the work isuninteresting and monotonous. That we should consider it a sort oftriumph that a man like Mr. John Burroughs should have been able tolive his life as he chose, travel along his own highroad, and develophimself in his own natural direction, is a curious reflection on ourideals of success and on the incompleteness of our civilization. Such aman has triumphed, however, because he has known what to dodge. He hasnot been crushed by the social opinion of his little world, or lured byspecious success, or fettered by his “job,” or hoodwinked by prejudice.He has kept his spirit clear and pure straight through life. It wouldbe well for modern youth if it could let an ideal like this color theirlives, and permeate all their thoughts and ambitions. It would be wellif they could keep before them such an ideal as a pillar of fire by dayand a cloud by night.If we cannot dodge this economic pressure, at least we can face it.If we are situated so that we have no choice in regard to our work,we may still resist the influences which its uncongeniality wouldbring to bear upon us. This is not done by forcing an interest init, or liking for it. If the work is socially wasteful or useless oreven pernicious, as so much business and industrial work to-day is,it is our bounden duty not to be interested in it or to like it. Weshould not be playing our right place in society if we enjoyed such aprostitution of energies. One of the most insidious of the economicpressures is this awaking the interest of youth in useless and wastefulwork, work that takes away energy from production to dissipate inbarter and speculation and all the thousand ways that men havediscovered of causing money to flow from one pocket to another withoutthe transference of any fair equivalent of real wealth. We can dodgethese pressures not by immolating ourselves, but by letting the routinework lie very lightly on our soul. We can understand clearly the natureand effects of this useless work we are doing, and keep it from eitheralluring or smothering us. We can cultivate a disinterested aloofnesstowards it, and keep from breathing its poisonous atmosphere. The extrahours we can fill with real interests, and make them glow with anintensity that will make our life almost as rich as if we were whollygiven over to a real lifework. We can thus live in two worlds, oneof which is the more precious because it is one of freedom from veryreal oppression. And that oppression will seem light because it has thereverse shield of liberty. If we do drudgery, it must be our care tosee that it does not stifle us. The one thing needful in all our workand play is that we should always be on top, that our true personalityshould always be in control. Our life must not be passive, runningsimply by the momentum furnished by another; it must have the motivepower within itself; although it gets the fuel from the stimulation ofthe world about it, the steam and power must be manufactured withinitself.These counsels of aloofness from drudgery suggest the possibilities ofavoiding the economic pressures where they are too heavy completely tododge, and where the work is an irrevocable misfit. But the pressuresof success are even more deadly than those of routine. How early isone affected by that first pressure of worldly opinion which says thatlack of success in business or a profession is disgraceful! The onedevil of our modern world is failure, and many are the charms used bythe medicine men to ward him away. If we lived in a state of societywhere virtue was its own reward, where our actions were automaticallymeasured and our rewards duly proportioned to our efforts, a lack ofsuccess would be a real indication of weakness and flaw, or, at best,ill-preparation. But where business success is largely dependent onthe possession of capital, a lucky risk, the ability to intimidate ordeceive, and where professional success is so often dependent uponself-assertion or some irrelevant but pleasing trait of personality,failure means nothing more than bad luck, or, at most, inability toplease those clients to whom one has made one’s appeal. To dodge thispressure of fancied failure and humiliation is to have gone a long waytowards guaranteeing one’s real success. We are justified in adoptinga pharisaical attitude towards success,--“Lord, I thank thee that Ihave not succeeded as other men have!” To have judged one’s self bythe inner standards of truth to one’s own personality, to count theconsciousness of having done well, regardless of the corroboration ofa public, as success, is to have avoided this most discouraging ofpressures.It is even doubtful whether business or professional success, exceptin the domain of science and art, can be attained without a certainbetrayal of soul. The betrayal may have been small, but at some pointone has been compressed, one has yielded to alien forces and conformedto what the heart did not give assent to. It may be that one has keptsilent when one should have spoken, that one has feigned interestsand enthusiasms, or done work that one knew was idle and useless, inorder to achieve some goal; but always that goal has been reached notspontaneously but under a foreign pressure. More often than not thefortunate one has not felt the direct pressure, has not been quiteconscious of the sacrifice, but only vaguely uneasy and aware that allwas not right within him, and has won his peace only by drugging hisuneasiness with visions of the final triumph. The pressure is alwaysupon him to keep silent and conform. He must not only adopt all theoutward forms and ceremonies, as in the family and social life, but hemust also adopt the traditional ideals.The novice soon finds that he is expected to defend the citadel, evenagainst his own heresies. The lawyer who finds anomalies in the law,injustice in the courts, is not encouraged to publish abroad hisfacts, or make proposals for reform. The student who finds antiquatedmethod, erroneous hypotheses in his subject, is not expected to usehis knowledge and his genius to remodel the study. The minister whocomes upon new and living interpretations for his old creeds is notencouraged to speak forth the truth that is in him. Nor is the businessman who finds corrupt practices in his business encouraged to give thesecrets away. There is a constant social pressure on these “reformers”to leave things alone.And this does not arise from any corrupt connivance with the wrong,or from any sympathy with the evildoers. The cry rises equally fromthe corrupt and the holy, from the men who are responsible for theabuses and those who are innocent, from those who know of them andthose who do not. It is simply the instinctive reaction of the herdagainst anything that savors of the unusual; it is the tendency ofevery social group simply to resist change. This alarm at innovation isuniversal, from college presidents to Catholic peasants, in fashionableclub or sewing circle or political party. On the radical there isimmediately brought, without examination, without reason or excuse,the whole pressure of the organization to stultify his vision andforce him back into the required grooves. The methods employed aremany: a warning is issued against him as being unsound and unsafe; hismotive is to make trouble, or revenge himself on the directors for someslight; finally he is solemnly pilloried as an “enemy of the people.”Excellent reasons are discovered for his suppression. Effective workingof an organization requires coöperation, but also subordination; inthe interests of efficiency, therefore, individual opinion cannot beallowed full sway. The reputation of the organization before the worlddepends on its presenting a harmonious and united front; internaldisagreements and criticisms tend to destroy the respect of the public.Smoothness of working is imperative; a certain individual liberty must,therefore, be sacrificed for the success of the organization. And ifthese plausible excuses fail, there is always the appeal to authorityand to tried and tested experience. Now all these reasons are simplyapologies brought up after the fact to justify the first instinctivereaction. What they all mean is this, and only this: He would unsettlethings; away with him!In olden times, they had sterner ways of enforcing these pressures.But although the stake and dungeon have disappeared, the spirit ofconservatism does not seem to have changed very much. Educated menstill defend the hoariest abuses, still stand sponsor for utterlyantiquated laws and ideals. That is why the youth of this generationhas to be so suspicious of those who seem to speak authoritatively. Heknows not whom he can trust, for few there are who speak from their owninner conviction. Most of our leaders and moulders of public opinionspeak simply as puppets pulled by the strings of the conservativebigotry of their class or group. It is well that the youth of to-dayshould know this, for the knowledge will go far towards steeling himagainst that most insidious form of pressure that comes from theintellectual and spiritual prestige of successful and honored men. Whenyouth sees that a large part of their success has been simply theirsuccumbing to social pressure, and that their honor is based largelyon the fact that they do not annoy vested interests with proposals oragitations for betterment, he will seek to discover new standards ofsuccess, and find his prophets and guides among the less fortunate,perhaps, but among those who have retained their real integrity.This numbing palsy of conservative assent which steals over so manybrilliant and sincere young men as they are subjected to the influenceof prestige and authority in their profession is the most dangerousdisease that threatens youth. It can be resisted only by constantcriticism and candid vigilance. “Prove all things; hold fast to thatwhich is good,” should be the motto of the intellectual life. Onlyby testing and comparing all the ideals that are presented to one isit possible to dodge that pressure of authority that would crush thesoul’s original enthusiasms and beliefs. Not doubt but convention isthe real enemy of youth.Yet these spiritual pressures are comparatively easy to dodge whenone is once awake to them. It is the physical pressure that those inpower are able to bring to bear upon the dissenter that constitutesthe real problem. The weak man soon becomes convinced of his hardihoodand audacity in supposing that his ideas could be more valuable thanthe running tradition, and recants his heresies. But those who stickstiff-neckedly out are soon crushed. When the youth is settled in life,has trained for his profession and burned his bridges behind him, itmeans a great deal to combat authority. For those in power can makeuse of the economic pressure to force him to conformity. It is theshame of our universities that they are giving constant illustrationsof this use of arbitrary power, directed usually against nonconformityin social and political opinion. Recent examples show the length towhich even these supposedly enlightened institutions are willing togo to prevent social heresy in their midst. Often such harsh measuresare not needed. A subtle appeal to a man’s honor is effective. “Whileyou are a member of a society,” it is said, “it is your duty to thinkin harmony with its ideals and policies. If you no longer agree withthose ideals, it is your duty to withdraw. You can fight honorably foryour own ideas only from the outside.” All that need be said about thisdoctrine, so fair and reasonable on the surface, is that it containsall the philosophic support that would perpetuate the evil of theworld forever. For it means attacking vested evil from the weakestvantage-point; it means willfully withdrawing to the greatest distance,shooting one’s puny arrows at the citadel, and then expecting tocapture it. It means also to deny any possibility of progress withinthe organization itself. For as soon as dissent from the common inertiadeveloped, it would be automatically eliminated. It is a principle,of course, that plays directly into the hands of the conservators. Itis an appeal to honor that is dishonorable. Let it seduce no man’ssincerity!The principal object of every organization, as every youth soondiscovers who feels dissatisfaction with the policies of church,club, college, or party, is to remain true to type. Each is organizedwith a central vigilance committee, whose ostensible function isdirection, but whose real business is to resist threatening changeand keep matters as they are. The ideal is smoothness; every part ofthe machine is expected to run along in its well-oiled groove. Youthswho have tried to introduce their new ideas into such organizationsknow the weight of this fearful resistance. It seems usually as ifall the wisdom and experience of these elders had taught them onlythe excellence of doing nothing at all. Their favorite epithet forthose who have individual opinions is “trouble-makers,” forgettingthat men do not run the risk of the unpopularity and opprobrium thataggressiveness always causes, for the sheer love of making trouble.Through an instinct of self-preservation, such an organization alwaysplaces loyalty above truth, the permanence of the organization abovethe permanence of its principles. Even in churches we are told that toalter one’s opinion of a creed to which one has once given allegianceis basely to betray one’s higher nature. These are the pressures thatkeep wavering men in the footpaths where they have once put their feet,and stunts their truer, growing selves. How many souls a false loyaltyhas blunted none can say; perhaps almost as many as false duty!In the dodging of these pressures many a man finds the real spiritualbattle of his life. They are a challenge to all his courage and faith.Unless he understands their nature, his defeat will bring despairor cynicism. When the group is weak and he is strong, he may resistsuccessfully, press back in his turn, actually create a public opinionthat will support him, and transfuse it all with his new spirit andattitude. Fortunate, indeed, is he who can not only dodge thesepressures but dissolve them! If he is weak and his efforts are useless,and the pressure threatens to crush him, he would better withdraw andlet the organization go to its own diseased perdition. If he can remainwithin without sacrifice to his principles, this is well, for then hehas a vantage-ground for the enunciation of those principles. Eternalvigilance, however, is the price of his liberty.The secret ambition of the group seems to be to turn out all itsmembers as nearly alike as possible. It seeks to create a type towhich all new adherents shall be moulded. Each group, then, that wehave relations with is ceaselessly working to mould us to its type andpattern. It is this marvellous unseen power that a group has of formingafter its own image all that come under its influence, that conquersmen. It has the two instincts of self-preservation and propagationstrongly developed, and we tend unthinkingly to measure its value interms of its success in the expression of those instincts. Rathershould it be measured always in terms of its ability to create andstimulate varied individuality. This is the new ideal of social life.This is what makes it so imperative that young men of to-day shouldrecognize and dodge the pressures that would thwart the assertion ofthis ideal. The aim of the group must be to cultivate personality,leaving open the road for each to follow his own. The bond of cohesionwill be the common direction in which those roads point, but this isfar from saying that all the travelers must be alike. It is enough thatthere be a common aim and a common ideal.Societies are rarely content with this, however; they demand a closemechanical similarity, and a conformity to a reactionary and not aprogressive type. If we would be resolute in turning our gaze towardsthe common aim, and dodging the pressure of the common pattern, ourfamily, business, and social life would be filled with a new spirit. Wecan scarcely imagine the achievement and liberation that would result.Individuality would come to its own; it would no longer be suspect.Youth would no longer be fettered and bound, but would come to its ownas the leaven and even leader of life. Men would worship progress asthey now worship stagnation; their ideal in working together would be aliving effectiveness instead of a mechanical efficiency.This gospel is no call to ease and comfort. It is rather one of peril.The youth of this generation will not be so lightly seduced, or go soinnocently into the bonds of conservatism and convention, under theimpression that they are following the inspired road to success. Theirconsciences will be more delicate. They know now the dangers thatconfront them and the road they are called on to tread. It is not aneasy road. It is beset with opportunities for real eccentricity, forselfishness, for willfulness, for mere bravado. It would be surprising,after the long premium that has been placed on the pattern, not to seea reaction in favor of sheer freakishness. Many of our modern radicalsare examples of this reaction. Yet their method is so sound, theirgoal so clear and noble, their spirit so sincere, that they are truepioneers of the new individuality. Their raciness is but the racinessof all pioneers everywhere. And much of their irresponsibility is aresult of that intolerable pressure against which they are revolting.They have dodged it, but it dogs them and concentrates itself sullenlybehind them to punish them for their temerity. The scorn of the worldhurts and hampers them. That ridicule which the family employed againstdeviation is employed in all large social movements against theinnovators. Yet slowly and surely the new social ideal makes its way.It is not a call to the surrendering of obligations, in familyor business or profession, but it is a call to the criticism ofobligations. Youth must distinguish carefully between the essentialduties and the non-essential, between those which make for therealization of the best common ideals, and those which make merely forthe maintenance of a dogma or unchallenged superstition. By resistingthe pressures that would warp, do we really best serve society; byallowing our free personality to develop, do we contribute most tothe common good. We must recognize that our real duty is always foundrunning in the direction of our worthiest desires. No duty that runsrough-shod over the personality can have a legitimate claim upon us. Weserve by being as well as by doing.It is easy to distort this teaching into a counsel to unbridledselfishness. And that, of course, is the risk. But shall we notdare to take the risk? It may be also that in our care to dodge thepressures, we may lose all the inestimable influences of good that comealong mixed in with the hurtful. But shall we not take the risk? Ourjudgments can only grow by exercise; we can only learn by constantlydiscriminating. Self-recognition is necessary to know one’s road, but,knowing the road, the price of the mistakes and perils is worth paying.The following of that road will be all the discipline one needs.Discipline does not mean being moulded by outside forces, but stickingto one’s road against the forces that would deflect or bury the soul.People speak of finding one’s niche in the world. Society, as we haveseen, is one vast conspiracy for carving one into the kind of a statueit likes, and then placing it in the most convenient niche it has.But for us, not the niche but the open road, with the spirit alwaystraveling, always criticizing, always learning, always escaping thepressures that threaten its integrity. With its own fresh power it willkeep strong and true to the journey’s end.XIIFOR RADICALSThe great social movement of yesterday and to-day and to-morrow hashit us of the younger generation hard. Many of us were early convertedto a belief in the possibilities of a regenerated social order, and toa passionate desire to do something in aid of that regeneration. Theappeal is not only to our sympathy for the weak and exploited, but alsoto our delight in a healthy, free, social life, to an artistic longingfor a society where the treasures of civilization may be open to all,and to our desire for an environment where we ourselves will be ableto exercise our capacities, and exert the untrammeled influences whichwe believe might be ours and our fellows’. All these good things thesocial movement seems to demand and seems to offer, and its appeal isirresistible. Before the age of machinery was developed, or beforethe structure of our social system and the relations between classesand individuals was revealed, the appeal might have been merelysentimental. But it is no longer so. The aims of the social movementto-day seem to have all the tremendous power of a practicable ideal.To the satisfactions which its separate ideals give to all the finerinstincts of men is added the overwhelming conviction that thosesatisfactions are most of them realizable here and now by concertedmethods which are already partly in operation and partially successful.It is this union of the idealistic and the efficient that gives themovement its hold on the disinterested and serious youth of to-day.With that conversion has necessarily come the transvaluation of manyof our social values. No longer can we pay the conventional respectto success or join in the common opinions of men and causes. Themighty have been pulled down from their seats, and those of low degreeexalted. We feel only contempt for college presidents, editors, andstatesmen who stultify their talents and pervert their logical andhistorical knowledge in defending outworn political philosophies andeconomic codes. We can no longer wholly believe in the usefulnessor significance of those teachers and writers who show themselvesserenely oblivious to the social problems. We become keen analysts ofthe society around us; we put uncomfortable questions to our sleekand successful elders. We criticize the activities in which theyengage, the hitherto sacred professions and businesses, and learn todistinguish carefully between actually productive work for society,work which makes for the material and spiritual well-being of thepeople for whom it is done, and parasitic or wasteful work, whichsimply extends the friction of competition, or lives on the labor orprofits of others. We distinguish, too, between the instruction andwriting that consists in handing down unexamined and uncriticized moraland political ideas, and ideas that let in the fresh air and sunlightto the thick prejudices of men. We come to test the papers we read,the teachers we learn from, the professional men we come into contactwith, by these new standards. Various and surprising are the newinterweavings we discover, and the contrasts and ironies of the modernintellectual life. The childlike innocence in which so many seem stillto slumber is almost incredible to those whose vision is so clear. Themechanical way in which educated men tend to absorb and repeat wholesystems of formulas is a constant surprise to those whose ideas humand clash and react against each other. But the minds of so many ofthese men of position seem to run in automatic channels, such that,given one set of opinions, one could predict with accuracy their wholephilosophy of life. Our distrust of their whole spiritual fabric thusbecomes fundamental. We can no longer take most of them seriously. Itis true that they are doing the serious work of the world, while wedo nothing as yet except criticize, and perhaps are doomed to failaltogether when we try. To be sure, it is exactly their way of doingthat serious work that we object to, but still we are the dreamers,they the doers; we are the theorists, they the practical achievers. Yetthe precision of our view will not down; we can see in their boastedactivity little but a resolute sitting on the lid, a sort of glorifiedroutine of keeping the desk clear. And we would rather remain dreamers,we feel, than do much of their work. Other values we find are changed.We become hopelessly perverted by democracy. We no longer make thecareful distinctions between the fit and the unfit, the successful andthe unsuccessful, the effective and the ineffective, the presentableand the unpresentable. We are more interested in the influences thathave produced these seeming differences than in the fact of thedifferences themselves. We classify people by new categories. We lookfor personality, for sincerity, for social sympathy, for democraticfeeling, for social productiveness, and we interpret success in termsof these attainments.The young radical, then, in such a situation and in possession of thesenew social values, stands on the verge of his career in a mood ofgreat perplexity. Two questions he must answer,--“What is to be done?”and “What must I do?” If he has had an education and is given a realopportunity for the choice of a vocation, his position is crucial. Forhis education, if it has been in one of the advanced universities, willhave only tended to confirm his radicalism and render more vivid thecontrast between the new philosophy which is being crystallized thereout of modern science and philosophy and the new interpretations ofhistory and ethics, and the obscurantist attitude of so many of ourintellectual guardians. The youth, ambitious and aggressive, desires aneffective and serviceable career, yet every career open to him seemsa compromise with the old order. If he has come to see the law as anattempt to fit immutable principles of social action on a dynamicand ever-growing society; if he has come to see the church as anorganization working along the lines of greatest spiritual resistance,preaching a personal where the world is crying for a social gospel;if he has come to see higher education as an esoteric institutionof savants, only casually reaching down to touch the mass of peoplewith their knowledge and ideas; if he has come to see business asa clever way of distributing unearned wealth, and the levying of arefined tribute on the property-less workers; if he has come to seethe press as devoted to bolstering up all these institutions in theirinefficiency and inertia;--if he has caught this radical vision of thesocial institutions about him, he will find it hard to fit neatly intoany of them and let it set its brand upon him. It would seem to be atreason not only to society but to his own best self. He would seem tohave become one of the vast conspiracy to keep things as they are. Hehas spent his youth, perhaps, in studying things as they are in orderto help in changing them into things as they ought to be, but he is nowconfronted with the question how the change can be accomplished, andhow he can help in that accomplishment.The attempt to answer these questions seems at first to bring him to adeadlock and to inhibit all his powers. He desires self-developmentand self-expression, and the only opportunities offered him seem to beways of life and training that will only mock the best social idealsthat he has. This is the dilemma of latter-day youth, and it is adilemma which is new and original to our own age. Earnest men andwomen have always had before them the task of adjusting themselvesto this world, of “overcoming the world,” but the proper method hasalways been found in withdrawing from it altogether, or in passingthrough it with as little spot and blemish as possible, not in plunginginto its activity and attempting to subjugate it to one’s ideals. Yetthis is the task that the young radical sets for himself. Subjugationwithout compromise! But so many young men and women feel that this isimpossible. Confident of their sincerity, yet distrustful of theirstrength, eager yet timorous, they stand on the brink, longing toserve, but not knowing how, and too likely, through their distrust andfears, to make a wreck of their whole lives. They feel somehow thatthey have no right to seek their own welfare or the training of theirown talents until they have paid that service to society which theyhave learned is its due.It does not do to tell them that one of their best services will bethat training. They demand some more direct way of influencing theirfellows, some short road to radical activity. It would be good for themto know that they cannot hope to accomplish very much in radiatingtheir ideals without the skill and personality which gives impetus tothat radiation. Good-will alone has little efficacy. For centurieswell-wishers of men have shown a touching faith in the power of pureideals to propagate themselves. The tragic failures of the beginningsof the social movement itself were largely due to this belief. Greatefforts ended only in sentimentality. But we have no intention now thatthe fund of intellectual and spiritual energy liberated by radicalthought in the younger generation shall die away in such ineffectiveefforts. To radiate influence, one’s light must shine before men, andit must glow, moreover, with a steady and resolute flame, or men willneither see nor believe the good works that are being done.It would be an easy way out of the dilemma if we could all adopt thesolution of Kropotkin, the Russian radical writer, and engage inradical journalism. This seems to be the most direct means of bringingone’s ideals to the people, to be a real fighting on the firingline. It is well to remember, however, that a weak propagandist is ahindrance rather than an assistance, and that the social movement needsthe best of talent, and the skill. This is a challenge to genius, butit is also a reminder that those who fight in other ranks than thefront may do as valiant and worthy service. One of the first lessonsthe young radical has to learn is that influence can be indirect aswell as direct, and will be strongest when backed by the most glowingpersonality. So that self-cultivation becomes almost a duty, if onewants to be effective towards the great end. And not only personalitybut prestige; for the prestige of the person from whom ideals come isone of the strongest factors in driving home those ideas to the mind ofthe hearer and making them a motive force in his life. Vested interestsdo not hesitate to make use of the services of college presidentsand other men of intellectual prestige to give their practices aphilosophic support; neither should radicals disdain, as many seem todisdain, the use of prestige as a vantage-ground from which to hurltheir dogmas. Even though Kropotkin himself deprecated his uselesslearning, his scientific reputation has been a great factor inspreading his radical ideas.It is the fashion among some radicals to despise the applause of theconventional, unthinking mass, and scorn any success which has thatappreciation as an ingredient. But this is not the way to influencethat same crass, unthinking mass or convert it to one’s doctrines. Itis to alienate at the beginning the heathen to whom the gospel is beingbrought. And even the radical has the right to be wise as a serpentand harmless as a dove. He must see merely that his distinctiveness isbased on real merit and not, as many reputations are, on conformityto an established code. Scientific research, engineering, medicine,and any honest craft, are vocations where it is hard to win prestigewithout being socially productive; their only disadvantage lies in thefact that their activity does not give opportunity for the influenceof the kind the radical wishes to exert. Art, literature, and teachingare perilous; the pressures to conform are deadly, but the triumphs ofindividuality splendid. For one’s daily work lies there directly inthe line of impressing other minds. The genius can almost swing thelash over men’s spirits, and form their ideas for them; he combinesenormous prestige with enormous direct influence. Law, the ministry,and business seem to be peculiarly deadly; it is hard to see howeminence can be attained in those professions except at the cost ofmany of one’s social ideals.The radical can thus choose his career with full knowledge of thesocial possibilities. Where he is forced by economic necessity toengage in distasteful and unsocial work, he may still leave no doubt,in the small realm he does illuminate, as to his attitude and hispurpose, his enthusiasm and his hope. For all his powers and talentscan be found to contribute something; fusing together they form hispersonality and create his prestige, and it is these that give thereal impetus and the vital impulse that drive one’s beliefs and idealsinto the hearts of other men. If he speaks, he will be listened to,for it is faith and not doubt that men strain their ears to hear. Itis the believing word that they are eager to hear. Let the socialfaith be in a youth, and it will leak out in every activity of hislife, it will permeate his words and color his deeds. The belief andthe vision are the essentials; these given, there is little need forhim to worry how he may count in society. He will count in spite ofhimself. He may never know just how he is counting, he may never hearthe reverberations of his own personality in others, but reverberate itwill, and the timbre and resonance will be in proportion to the qualityand power of that vision.The first concrete duty of every youth to whom social idealism is morethan a phrase is to see that he is giving back to society as muchas or more than he receives, and, moreover, that he is a nourisherof the common life and not a drain upon its resources. This wasTolstoy’s problem, and his solution to the question--“What is to bedone?”--was--“Get off the other fellow’s back!” His duty, he found,was to arrange his life so that the satisfaction of his needs did notinvolve the servitude or the servility of any of his fellow men; to doaway with personal servants, and with the articles of useless luxurywhose production meant the labor of thousands who might otherwise havebeen engaged in some productive and life-bringing work; to make his ownliving either directly from the soil, or by the coöperative exchange ofservices, in professional, intellectual, artistic, or handicraft labor.Splendidly sound as this solution is, both ethically and economically,the tragic fact remains that so inextricably are we woven into thesocial web that we cannot live except in some degree at the expense ofsomebody else, and that somebody is too often a man, woman, or evenlittle child who gives grudgingly, painfully, a stint of labor that wemay enjoy. We do not see the labor and the pain, and with easy heartsand quiet consciences we enjoy what we can of the good things of life;or, if we see the truth, as Tolstoy saw it, we still fancy, like him,that we have it in our power to escape the curse by simple living andour own labor. But the very food we eat, the clothes we wear, thesimplest necessities of life with which we provide ourselves, havetheir roots somewhere, somehow, in exploitation and injustice. It is acardinal necessity of the social system under which we live that thisshould be so, where the bulk of the work of the world is done, not forhuman use and happiness, but primarily and directly for the profits ofmasters and owners. We are all tainted with the original sin; we cannotescape our guilt. And we can be saved out of it only by the skill andenthusiasm which we show in our efforts to change things. We cannothelp the poisonous soil from which our sustenance springs, but we canbe laboring mightily at agitating that soil, ploughing it, turning it,and sweetening it, against the day when new seed will be planted and afairer fruitage be produced.The solution of these dilemmas of radical youth will, therefore, notcome from a renunciation of the personality or a refusal to participateactively in life. Granted the indignation at our world as it is,and the vision of the world as it might and ought to be, both theheightening of all the powers of the personality and a firm grapplingwith some definite work-activity of life are necessary to make thatindignation powerful and purging, and to transmute that vision intoactual satisfaction for our own souls and those of our fellows. It isa fallacy of radical youth to demand all or nothing, and to view everypartial activity as compromise. Either engage in something that willbring revolution and transformation all at one blow, or do nothing,it seems to say. But compromise is really only a desperate attemptto reconcile the irreconcilable. It is not compromise to study tounderstand the world in which one lives, to seek expression for one’sinner life, to work to harmonize it and make it an integer, nor is itcompromise to work in some small sphere for the harmonization of sociallife and the relations between men who work together, a harmonizationthat will bring democracy into every sphere of life, industrial andsocial.Radical youth is apt to long for some supreme sacrifice and feels thata lesser surrender is worth nothing. But better than sacrifice isefficiency! It is absurd to stand perplexedly waiting for the greatoccasion, unwilling to make the little efforts and test the littleoccasions, and unwilling to work at developing the power that wouldmake those occasions great. Of all the roads of activity that liebefore the youth at the threshold of life, one paramount road must betaken. This fear that one sees so often in young people, that, if theychoose one of their talents or interests or opportunities of influenceand make themselves in it “competent ones of their generation,” theymust slaughter all the others, is irrational. It is true that the sternpresent demands singleness of purpose and attention. A worthy successis impossible to-day if the labor is divided among many interests. Ina more leisurely time, the soul could encompass many fields, and evento-day the genius may conquer and hold at once many spiritual kingdoms.But this is simply a stern challenge to us all to make ourselvesgeniuses. For serious and sincere as the desire of radical youth maybe to lead the many-sided life, a life without a permanent core ofactive and productive interest, of efficient work in the world, leadsto dilettantism and triviality. Such efficient work, instead of killingthe other interests of life, rather fertilizes them and makes them inturn enrich the central activity. Instead of feeding on their time, itactually creates time for the play of the other interests, which is allthe sweeter for its preciousness.Always trying to make sure that the work, apart from the inevitabletaint of exploitation which is involved in modern work, is sociallyproductive, that it actually in some way contributes to the materialor spiritual welfare of the people for whom it is done, and does notsimply reiterate old formulas, does not simply extend the frictionof competition or consist simply in living on the labor and profitsof others. Such work cannot be found by rule. The situation is areal dilemma for the idealistic youth of to-day, and its solution isto be worked out in the years to come. It is these crucial dilemmasthat make this age so difficult to live in, that make life so hard toharmonize and integrate. The shock of the crassnesses and crudities ofthe modern social world thrown against the conventionally satisfyingpicture which that world has formed of itself makes any young life ofpurpose and sincerity a real peril and adventure. There are all sortsof spiritual disasters lying in wait for the youth who embarks on theperilous ocean of radicalism. The disapproval of those around him islikely to be the least of his dangers. It should rather fortify hissoul than discourage him. Far more dangerous is it that he lose his wayon the uncharted seas before him, or follow false guides to shipwreck.But the solution is not to stay at home, fearful and depressed. It israther to cultivate deliberately the widest knowledge, the broadestsympathy, the keenest insight, the most superb skill, and then setsail, exulting in one’s resources, and crowding on every inch of sail.For if the radical life has its perils, it also has its great rewards.The strength and beauty of the radical’s position is that he alreadyto a large extent lives in that sort of world which he desires. Manypeople there are who would like to live in a world arranged in somesort of harmony with socialistic ideals, but who, believing theyare impossible, dismiss the whole movement as an idle if delightfuldream. They thus throw away all the opportunity to have a sharein the extending of those ideals. They do not see that the gradualinfiltration of those ideals into our world as it is does brighten andsweeten it enormously. They do not know the power and advantage ofeven their “little faith” which their inclinations might give them.But the faith of the radical has already transformed the world inwhich he lives. He sees the “muddle” around him, but what he actuallyfeels and lives are the germs of the future. His mind selects out theliving, growing ideas and activities of the socially fruitful thatexist here and now, and it is with these that his soul keeps company;it is to their growth and cultivation that he is responsive. This isno illusion that he knows, no living in a pleasing but futile world offancy. For this living the socialistic life as far as he is able, hebelieves has its efficient part in creating that communal life of thefuture. He feels himself, not as an idle spectator of evolution, but asan actual co-worker in the process. He does not wait timidly to jumpuntil all the others are ready to jump; he jumps now, and anticipatesthat life which all desire, but which most, through inertia, prejudice,insufficient knowledge, and feeble sympathy, distrust or despair of.He knows that the world runs largely on a principle of imitation,and he launches boldly his personality into society, confident of itseffect in polarizing the ideas and attitudes of the wistful. Towardshimself he finds gravitating the sort of people that he would findin a regenerated social order. To him come instinctively out of hisreading and his listening the ideas and events that give promise ofthe actual realization of his ideals. In unlooked-for spots he findsthe seeds of regeneration already here. In the midst of the sternestpracticalities he finds blossoming those activities and personalitieswhich the unbelieving have told him were impossible in a human world.And he finds, moreover, that it is these activities and personalitiesthat furnish all the real joy, the real creation, the real life of thepresent. The prophets and the teachers he finds are with him. In hiscamp he finds all those writers and leaders who sway men’s minds to-dayand make their life, all unconscious as they are of the revolutionarycharacter of the message, more rich and dynamic. To live this life ofhis vision practically here in the present is thus the exceeding greatreward of radical youth. And this life, so potent and glowing amongstthe crude malignity of modern life, fortifies and stimulates him, andgives him the surety, which is sturdier than any dream or hope, ofthe coming time when this life will permeate and pervade all societyinstead of only a part.XIIITHE COLLEGE: AN INNER VIEWThe undergraduate of to-day, if he reads the magazines, discoversthat a great many people are worrying seriously about his condition.College presidents and official investigators are discussing hisscholarship, his extra-curricular activities, and his moral stamina.Not content with the surface of the matter, they are going deeper andare investigating the college itself, its curriculum, the scholarshipof the instructors, and its adequacy in realizing its high ideal asa preparation for life. The undergraduate finds that these observersare pretty generally inclined to exonerate him for many of hisshortcomings, and to lay the blame on the college itself; the system isindicted, and not the helpless product.For this he is grateful, and he realizes that this dissatisfactionamong educators, this uneasy searching of the academic heart, promiseswell for the education of his children, and for himself if he remainsin college long enough to get the benefit of the reforms. Meanwhile,as he attends recitations and meetings of undergraduate societies,talks with his fellow students and the professors, and reads thecollege papers, he may, even if he can get no hint of the mysteriousinner circles where the destinies of the students are shaped and greatquestions of policy decided, be able himself to see some of the thingsthat complicate college scholarship to-day, from an inner point ofview which is impossible to the observer looking down from above. Hemay find in the character of the student body itself, and the way inwhich it reacts to what the college offers it, an explanation of someof the complications of scholarship that so disturb our critics; and ina certain new quality in the spirit of the college, something that isbeginning to crystallize his own ideals, and to make him count himselffortunate that he is receiving his education in this age and no other.In the constitution of college society, and in the intellectual andspiritual ideals of the teachers, he may find the explanation of whythe college is as it is, and the inspiration of what the college oughtto be and is coming to be.The first thing that is likely to impress the undergraduate is theobservation that college society is much less democratic than it usedto be. It is to be expected, of course, that it will be simply anepitome of the society round about it. But the point is, that whereasthe college of the past was probably more democratic than the societyabout it, the present-day college is very much less democratic.Democracy does not require uniformity, but it does require a certainhomogeneity, and the college to-day is less homogeneous than that ofour fathers. For the growing preponderance of the cities has meantthat an ever-increasing proportion of city-bred men go to college, incontrast to the past, when the men were drawn chiefly from the smalltowns and country districts. Since social distinctions are very muchmore sharply marked in the city than in the country, this trend hasbeen a potent influence in undemocratizing the college. In ordinarycity life these distinctions are not yet, at least, insistent enough tocause any particular class feeling, but in the ideal world of collegelife they become aggravated, and sufficiently acute to cause muchmisunderstanding and ill-feeling. With increasing fashionableness,the small college, until recently the stronghold of democracy, isbeginning to succumb, and to acquire all those delicately devised,subtle forms of snobbery which have hitherto characterized the lifeof the large college. If this tendency continues, the large collegewill have a decided advantage as a preparation for life, for as a ruleit is situated in a large city, where the environment more nearlyapproximates the environment of after life than does the artificial andsheltered life of the small college.The presence of aliens in large numbers in the big colleges, andincreasingly in the smaller colleges, is an additional factor incomplicating the social situation. It ought not to be ignored, forit has important results in making the college considerably lessdemocratic even than would otherwise be the case. It puts the Americanrepresentatives on the defensive, so that they draw still more closelytogether for self-defense, and pull more tightly their lines of vestedinterest and social and political privilege. The prejudice of racecan always be successfully appealed to in undergraduate matters,even to the extent of beguiling many men with naturally democraticconsciences into doing things which they would murmur at if calledon to do as individuals, and not as the protectors of the socialprestige of the college. The fraternities are of course the centre ofthis vast political system which fills the athletic managerships,selects members of the societies, officers of classes and clubs,editors and assistants of publications, and performs generally allthat indispensable public service of excluding the aliens, theunpresentable, and the generally unemployable from activity.I am aware that most of the colleges pride themselves on the factthat the poor man has an equal chance with the rich to-day to winextra-curricular honors, and mingle in college society on a perfectplane of social equality with the best. It is true, of course, thatin college as in real life the exceptional man will always riseto the top. But this does not alter the fact that there exists attoo many American colleges a wholesale disfranchisement from anyparticipation in the extra-curricular activities, that is not based onany recognizable principle of talent or ability. It is all probablyinherent in the nature of things, and to cavil at it sets one down aschildish and unpractical. At present it certainly seems inevitableand unalterable. The organized efforts of the President recently todemocratize the social situation at Princeton met with such dull,persistent hostility on the part of the alumni that they had to beabandoned.This social situation in the college is not very often mentionedin the usual discussions of college problems, but I have dwelt onit here at length because I believe that it has a direct bearing onscholarship. For it creates an eternal and irreconcilable conflictbetween scholarship and extra-curricular activities. Scholarship isfundamentally democratic. Before the bar of marks and grades, pennilessadventurer and rich man’s son stand equal. In college society,therefore, with its sharply marked social distinctions, scholarshipfails to provide a satisfactory field for honor and reputation. Thisimplies no dislike to scholarship as such on the part of the rulingclass in college society, but means simply that scholarship forces anunwelcome democratic standard on a naturally undemocratic society. Thisclass turns therefore to the extra-curricular activities as a superiorfield for distinction, a field where honor will be done a man, notonly for his ability, but for the undefinable social prestige which hebrings along with him to college from the outside world. There is thusa division of functions,--the socially fit take the fraternities, themanagerships, the publications, the societies; the unpresentable takethe honors and rewards of scholarship. Each class probably gets justwhat it needs for after life. The division would thus be palpably fairwere it not for the fact that an invidious distinction gets attached tothe extra-curricular activities, which turns the energy of many of themost capable and talented men, men with real personality and powers ofleadership, men without a taint of snobbery, into a mad scramble forthese outside places, with consequent, but quite unintentional, badeffects on their scholarship.The result of all this is, of course, a general lowering of scholarshipin the college. The ruling class is content with passing marks, andhas no ambition to excel in scholarship, for it does not feel that theattainment of scholars’ honors confers the distinctions upon it thatit desires. In addition, this listlessness for scholarship serves toretard the work of the scholarly portion of the classes; it makes theinstructor work harder, and clogs up generally the work of the course.This listlessness may be partly due to another factor in the situation.An ever larger proportion of college students to-day comes from thebusiness class, where fifty years ago it came from the professionalclass. This means a difference between the intellectual background ofthe home that the man leaves and of the college to which he comes,very much greater than when college training was still pretty muchthe exclusive property of the professional man or the solid merchant,and almost an hereditary matter. For, nowadays, probably a majorityof undergraduates are sent to college by fathers who have not had acollege education themselves, but who, reverencing, as all Americansdo, Education if not Learning, are ambitious that their sons shallhave its benefits. These parents can well afford to set their sons uphandsomely so that they shall lose nothing of the well-rounded trainingthat makes up college life; and although it is doubtful whether theiridea of the result is much more than a vague feeling that collegewill give their boys tone, and polish them off much in the way thatthe young ladies’ boarding-school polishes off the girls, they area serious factor to be reckoned with in any discussion of collegeproblems.Most of these young men come thus from homes of conventional religion,cheap literature, and lack of intellectual atmosphere, bring fewintellectual acquisitions with them, and, since they are most of themgoing into business, and will therefore make little practical use ofthese acquisitions in after life, contrive to carry a minimum awaywith them. In the college courses and talks with their instructors theycome into an intellectual atmosphere that is so utterly different fromwhat they have been accustomed to that, instead of an intellectualsympathy between instructor and student, there ensues an intellectualstruggle that is demoralizing to both. The instructor has sometimes tocarry on a veritable guerilla warfare of new ideas against the pupilsin his courses, with a disintegrating effect that is often far fromhappy. If he does not disintegrate, he too often stiffens the youth,if of the usually tough traditional cast of mind, into an impregnableresolution that defies all new ideas forever after. This divergenceof ideals and attitudes toward life is one of the most interestingcomplications of scholarship, for it is dramatic and flashes out in theclass-room, in aspects at times almost startling.There is still another thing that complicates scholarship, at least inthe larger colleges that have professional schools. Two or three yearsof regular college work are now required to enter the schools of law,medicine, divinity, and education. An undergraduate who looks forwardto entering these professional schools, too often sees this period ofcollege work as a necessary but troublesome evil which must be gonethrough with as speedily as possible. In his headlong rush he is aptto slight his work, or take a badly synthesized course of studies, or,in an effort to get all he can while he is in the college, to gorgehimself with a mass of material that cannot possibly be digested.Now, the college work is of course only prescribed in order that theprofessional man may have a broad background of general culture beforehe begins to specialize. Any hurrying through defeats this purpose, andrenders this preliminary work worse than useless. A college course musthave a chance to digest if it is to be at all profitable to a man; anddigestion takes time. Between the listlessness of the business youthswho have no particular interest in scholarship, and the impetuosity ofthe prospective professional man who wants to get at his tools, theordinary scholar who wants to learn to think, to get a robust sort ofculture in an orderly and leisurely way, and feel his mental musclesgrowing month by month, gets the worst of it, or at least has littleattention paid to him. The instructor is so busy, drumming on thelaggards or restraining the reckless, that the scholar has to work outmuch of his own salvation alone.Whether or not all this is good for the scholar in cultivating hisself-reliance, the general level of scholarship certainly suffers.Neither the college administration nor the faculties have beenentirely guiltless, in the past, of yielding before the rising tideof extra-curricular activities. Athletics, through the protection,supervision, and even financial assistance, of the college, have becomea thoroughly unwholesome excrescence on college life. They have becomethe nucleus for a perverted college sentiment. College spirit has cometo mean enthusiasm for the winning of a game, and a college that hasno football team is supposed to have necessarily no college spirit.Pride and loyalty to Alma Mater, the prestige of one’s college, one’sown collegiate self-respect, get bound up and dependent upon a winningseason at athletics. It seems amazing sometimes to the undergraduatehow the college has surrendered to the student point of view.Instructors too often, in meeting students informally, assume that theymust talk about what is supposed to interest the student rather thantheir own intellectual interests. They do not deceive the student,and they do miss a real opportunity to impress their personality uponhim and to awaken him to a recognition of a broader world of vitalinterests than athletic scores and records.If the college would take away its patronage of athletics, which putsa direct premium on semi-professionalism, would circumscribe theclub-house features of the fraternities, and force some more democraticmethod of selection on the undergraduate societies, would it have theeffect of raising the general level of scholarship? It surely seemsthat such a movement on the part of the college administration wouldresult in keeping athletics proportioned directly to the interest thatthe student body took in it, to the extent of their participationin it, and the voluntary support that they gave to it, instead ofto the amount of money that an army of graduate managers and alumniassociations can raise for it and to the exertions of paid professionalcoaches and volunteer rah-rah boys. This would permit college sentimentto flow back into its natural channels, so that the undergraduate mightbegin to feel some pride in the cultural prestige of his college, andacquire a new respect for the scholarly achievements of its big men.This would mean an awakened interest in scholarship. The limitation ofextra-curricular activities would mean that that field would becomeless adequate as a place for acquiring distinction; opportunity wouldbe diminished, and it would become more and more difficult to maintainsocial eminence as the _sine qua non_ of campus distinction. Who knowsbut what these activities might be finally abandoned entirely to theunpresentable class, and the ruling class seize upon the field ofscholarship as a surer way of acquiring distinction, since the old godshad fled?If the college is not yet ready to adopt so drastic an attitude, it hasat least already begun to preach democracy. It is willing to preachinspirationally what it cannot yet do actively. In the last few yearsthere has been creeping into the colleges in the person of the youngerteachers a new spirit of positive conviction, a new enthusiasm, thatmakes a college education to-day a real inspiration to the man whocan catch the message. And at the risk of being considered a traitorto his class, the sincere undergraduate of to-day must realize thechanged attitude, and ally himself with his radical teachers in spiritand activity. He then gets an altered view of college life. He beginsto see the college course as an attempt, as yet not fully organizedbut becoming surer of its purpose as time goes on, to convert theheterogeneous mass of American youth--scions of a property-gettingclass with an antiquated tradition and ideals that are out of harmonywith the ideals of the leaders of thought to-day; slightly dispiritedaliens, whose racial ideals have been torn and confused by thedisintegrating influences of American life; men of hereditary culture;penniless adventurers hewing upward to a profession--to a democratic,realistic, scientific attitude toward life that will harmonize andexplain the world as a man looks at it, enable him to interpret humannature in terms of history and the potentialities of the future, andfurnish as solid and sure an intellectual and spiritual support as theold religious background of our fathers that has been fading these manyyears.This is the work of the college of to-day, as it was the work ofthe college of fifty years ago to justify the works of God to man.The college thus becomes for the first time in American history areorganizing force. It has become thoroughly secularized these lasttwenty years, and now finds arrayed against it, in spirit at least ifnot in open antagonism, the churches and the conservative moulders ofopinion. The college has a great opportunity before it to become, notonly the teacher, but the inspirational centre of the thought andideals of the time.If to the rising generation our elders rarely seem quitecontemporaneous in their criticisms of things, we in turn are apt totake the ordinary for the unique. We may be simply reading into thecollege our own enthusiasms, and may attribute to the college a newattitude when it is ourselves that are different. But I am sure thatsome such ideal is vaguely beginning to crystallize in the minds of theyounger professors and the older undergraduates, or those who have beenout in the world long enough to get a slightly objective point of view.The passing of the classics has meant much more than a mere changein the curriculum of the college; it has meant a complete shiftingof attitude. The classics as a cultural core about which the otherdisciplines were built up have given place to the social sciences,especially history, which is hailed now by some of its enthusiasticdevotees as the sum of all knowledge. The union of humanistic spiritwith scientific point of view, which has been longed for these manyyears, seems on the point of being actually achieved, and it is the newspirit that the colleges seem to be propagating.I am sure that it is a democratic spirit. History, economics, and theother social sciences are presented as the record of the developmentof human freedom, and the science of man’s social life. We are toldto look on institutions not as rigid and eternally fixed, but asfluid and in the course of evolution to an ever higher cultivation ofindividuality and general happiness, and to cast our thinking on publicquestions into this new mould. A college man is certainly not educatedto-day unless he gets this democratic attitude. That is what makes thearistocratic organization of undergraduate life doubly unfortunate. Forone of the most valuable opportunities of college life is the chance toget acquainted, not politely and distantly, but intimately, with alltypes of men and minds from all parts of the country and all classesof society, so that one may learn what the young men of the generationare really thinking and hoping. Knowledge of men is an indispensablefeature of a real education: not a knowledge of their weaknesses, astoo many seem to mean by the phrase, but knowledge of their strengthand capabilities, so that one may get the broadest possible sympathywith human life as it is actually lived to-day, and not as it is seenthrough the idealistic glasses of former generations. The associationonly with men of one’s own class, such as the organization of collegelife to-day fosters, is simply fatal to any broad understanding oflife. The refusal to make the acquaintance while in college of as manyas possible original, self-dependent personalities, regardless of raceand social status, is morally suicidal. There are indications, however,that the preaching of the democratic gospel is beginning to have itsinfluence, in the springing-up of college forums and societies which dowithout the rigid coöptation that has cultivated the cutting one’s selfoff from one’s fellows.I am sure that it is a scientific spirit. The scientific attitudetoward life is no longer kept as the exclusive property of thetechnical schools. It has found its way into those studies that havebeen known as humanistic, but, in penetrating, it has become coloreditself, so that the student is shown the world, not as a relentlessmachine, running according to mechanical laws, but as an organism,profoundly modifiable and directive by human will and purpose. Helearns that the world in which he lives is truly a mechanism, buta mechanism that exists for the purpose of turning out productsas man shall direct for the enrichment of his own life. He learnsto appreciate more the application to social life of machinery inorganization and coöperation; he gets some idea of the forces thatbuild up human nature and sway men’s actions. He acquires an impartialway of looking at things; effort is made to get him to separate hispersonal prejudices from the larger view, and get an objective visionof men and events. The college endeavors with might and main tocultivate in him an open-mindedness, so that at twenty-five he will notclose up to the entrance of new ideas, but will find his college coursemerely introductory to life, a learning of one’s bearings in a greatworld of thought and activity, and an inspiration to a constant workingfor better things.I am sure that it is a critical spirit. A critical attitude towardlife is as bad a thing for a boy as it is an indispensable thing foran educated man. The college tries to cultivate it gradually in itsstudents, so that by the end of his four years a man will have comesimply not to take everything for granted, but to test and weigh andprove ideas and institutions with which he comes in contact. Of coursethe results are unfortunate when this critical attitude comes with asudden shock so as to be a mere disillusionment, the turning yellowof a beautiful world; but it must come if a man is to see wisely andunderstand. The college must teach him to criticize without rancor, andsee that his cynicism, if that must come too, is purging and cleansingand not bitter.And lastly, I am sure that it is an enthusiastic spirit. The collegewants to give a man a keen desire for social progress, a love for thearts, a delight in sheer thinking, and a confidence in his own powers.It will do little good to teach a man about what men have thought anddone and built unless some spark is kindled, some reaction producedthat will have consequences for the future; it will do little goodto teach him about literature and the arts unless some kind of anemotional push is imparted to him that will drive him on to teachhimself further and grow into a larger appreciation of the best; itwill do little good to enforce scientific discipline unless by itthe mind is forged into a keener weapon for attacking problems andsolving them scientifically and not superficially. And it is just thisenthusiasm that the college, and only the college, can impart. We comethere to learn from men, not from books. We could learn from booksas well at home, but years of individual study will not equal theinspirational value of one short term of listening to the words of awise and good man. Only enthusiasm can knit the scattered ideals andtimorous aspirations into a constructive whole.Some such spirit as I have endeavored to outline, the college isbeginning to be infused with to-day; some such spirit the undergraduatemust get if he is to be in the best sense educated and adequatelyequipped for the complex work of the world. If such a spirit isinstilled, it almost matters little what the details of his coursesare, or the mere material of his knowledge. Such an attitude will be asufficient preparation for life, and adequate training for citizenship.We want citizens who are enthusiastic thinkers, not docile anduncritical followers of tradition; we want leaders of public opinionwith the scientific point of view: unclassed men, not men like theleaders of the passing generation, saturated with class prejudices andclass ideals.The college is rapidly revising its curriculum in line with the newstandards. The movement is so new, to be sure, that things have hardlygot their bearings yet. Men who graduated only ten years ago tell methat there was nothing like this new spirit when they were in college.The student finds a glut of courses, and flounders around for two orthree years before he gets any poise at all. A judicious mixture ofcompulsory and elective courses seems to be furnishing a helpful guide,and a system of honor courses like that recently introduced at Columbiaprovides an admirable means, not only to a more intensive culture, butalso to the synthesis of intellectual interests that creates a definiteattitude toward life, and yet for the absence of which so many youngmen of ability and power stand helpless and undecided on the thresholdof active life. To replace the classics, now irretrievably gone as thebackbone of the curriculum, the study of history seems an admirablediscipline, besides furnishing the indispensable background for theliterary and philosophical studies. Scientific ethics and socialpsychology should occupy an important place in the revised curriculum.The college cannot afford to leave the undergraduate to the mercies ofconventional religion and a shifting moral tradition.The pedantic, Germanistic type of scholarship is rapidly passing.The divisions, between the departments are beginning to break down.Already the younger instructors are finding their ideal professor inthe man who, while he knows one branch thoroughly, is interested in awide range of subjects. The departments are reacting upon one another;both undergraduates and instructors are coming to see intellectuallife as a whole, and not as a miscellaneous collection of specializedchunks of knowledge. The type of man is becoming common who could go toalmost any other department of the college and give a suggestive andinteresting, if not erudite, lecture on some subject in connection withits work. It is becoming more and more common now that when you touch aprofessor you touch a man and not an intellectual specialty.The undergraduate himself is beginning to react strongly to this sortof scholarship. He catches an inspiration from the men in the facultywho exhibit it, and he is becoming expert in separating the sheep fromthe goats. He does not want experiments in educational psychology triedupon him: all he demands in his teacher is personality. He wants tofeel that the instructor is not simply passing on dead knowledge in theform it was passed on to him, but that he has assimilated it and hasread his own experience into it, so that it has come to mean more tohim than almost anything in the world.Professors are fond of saying that they like to have their studentsreact to what they bring them; the student in turn likes to feel thatthe professor himself has reacted to what he is teaching. Otherwise histeaching is very apt to be in vain. American youth are very much lessdocile than they used to be, and they are little content any longer tohave second-hand knowledge, a little damaged in transit, thrust uponthem. The undergraduate wants to feel that the instructor is giving himhis best all the time, a piece out of the very warp and woof of his ownthinking.The problem of the college in the immediate future is thus to makethese ideals good, to permeate undergraduate society with the newspirit, and to raise the level of scholarship by making learning not anend in itself but a means to life. The curriculum and administrativeroutine will be seen simply as means to the cultivation of an attitudetowards life. As the ideals crystallize out and the college becomessurer and surer of its purpose, it will find itself leading the thoughtof the age in new channels of conviction and constructive statesmanshipthrough its inspirational influence on the young men of the time.Admitting that these ideals are still unorganized and unestablished,that in many of the colleges they have hardly begun to appear, whileeven in the larger ones they are little more than tendencies asyet,--is it too much to hope that a few years will see the collegeconscious of its purpose, and already beginning to impose on the rankand file of its members, instructors and undergraduates alike, theideals which have been felt this last decade by the more sensitive?XIVA PHILOSOPHY OF HANDICAPIt would not perhaps be thought, ordinarily, that the man whom physicaldisabilities have made so helpless that he is unable to move aroundamong his fellows, can bear his lot more happily, even though he sufferpain, and face life with a more cheerful and contented spirit, thancan the man whose handicaps are merely enough to mark him out from therest of his fellows without preventing him from entering with theminto most of their common affairs and experiences. But the fact isthat the former’s very helplessness makes him content to rest and notto strive. I know a young man so helplessly disabled that he has to becarried about, who is happy in reading a little, playing chess, takinga course or two in college, and all with the sunniest good-will inthe world, and a happiness that seems strange and unaccountable to myrestlessness. He does not cry for the moon.When the handicapped youth, however, is in full possession of hisfaculties, and can move about freely, he is perforce drawn into allthe currents of life. Particularly if he has his own way in the worldto make, his road is apt to be hard and rugged, and he will penetrateto an unusual depth in his interpretation both of the world’s attitudetoward such misfortunes, and of the attitude toward the world whichsuch misfortunes tend to cultivate in men like him. For he has all thebattles of a stronger man to fight, and he is at a double disadvantagein fighting them. He has constantly with him the sense of being obligedto make extra efforts to overcome the bad impression of his physicaldefects, and he is haunted with a constant feeling of weakness andlow vitality which makes effort more difficult and renders him easilyfaint-hearted and discouraged by failure. He is never confident ofhimself, because he has grown up in an atmosphere where nobody has beenvery confident of him; and yet his environment and circumstances callout all sorts of ambitions and energies in him which, from the natureof his case, are bound to be immediately thwarted. This attitude islikely to keep him at a generally low level of accomplishment unless hehave an unusually strong will, and a strong will is perhaps the lastthing to develop under such circumstances.The handicapped man is always conscious that the world does notexpect very much from him. And it takes him a long time to see inthis a challenge instead of a firm pressing down to a low level ofaccomplishment. As a result, he does not expect very much of himself;he is timid in approaching people, and distrustful of his ability topersuade and convince. He becomes extraordinarily sensitive to otherpeople’s first impressions of him. Those who are to be his friends heknows instantly, and further acquaintance adds little to the intimacyand warm friendship that he at once feels for them. On the other hand,those who do not respond to him immediately cannot by any effort eitheron his part or theirs overcome that first alienation.This sensitiveness has both its good and its bad sides. It makesfriendship the most precious thing in the world to him, and he findsthat he arrives at a much richer and wider intimacy with his friendsthan do ordinary men with their light, surface friendships, based ongood fellowship or the convenience of the moment. But on the other handthis sensitiveness absolutely unfits him for business and the practiceof a profession, where one must be “all things to all men,” and theprofessional manner is indispensable to success. For here, where hehas to meet a constant stream of men of all sorts and conditions, hissensitiveness to these first impressions will make his case hopeless.Except with those few who by some secret sympathy will seem to respond,his physical deficiencies will stand like a huge barrier between hispersonality and other men’s. The magical good fortune of attractivepersonal appearance makes its way almost without effort in the world,breaking down all sorts of walls of disapproval and lack of interest.Even the homely person can attract by personal charm.The doors of the handicapped man are always locked, and the key ison the outside. He may have treasures of charm inside, but they willnever be revealed unless the person outside coöperates with him inunlocking the door. A friend becomes, to a much greater degree thanwith the ordinary man, the indispensable means of discovering one’s ownpersonality. One only exists, so to speak, with friends. It is easyto see how hopelessly such a sensitiveness incapacitates a man forbusiness, professional or social life, where the hasty and superficialimpression is everything, and disaster is the fate of the man who hasnot all the treasures of his personality in the front window, wherethey can be readily inspected and appraised.It thus takes the handicapped man a long time to get adjusted to hisworld. Childhood is perhaps the hardest time of all. As a child he isa strange creature in a strange land. It was my own fate to be juststrong enough to play about with the other boys, and attempt all theirgames and “stunts,” without being strong enough actually to succeed inany of them. It never used to occur to me that my failures and lack ofskill were due to circumstances beyond my control, but I would alwaysimpute them, in consequence of my rigid Calvinistic bringing-up, Isuppose, to some moral weakness of my own. I suffered tortures intrying to learn to skate, to climb trees, to play ball, to conformin general to the ways of the world. I never resigned myself to theinevitable, but over-exerted myself constantly in a grim determinationto succeed. I was good at my lessons, and through timidity ratherthan priggishness, I hope, a very well-behaved boy at school; I wasdevoted, too, to music, and learned to play the piano pretty well. ButI despised my reputation for excellence in these things, and instead ofadapting myself philosophically to the situation, I strove and havebeen striving ever since to do the things I could not.As I look back now it seems perfectly natural that I should havefollowed the standards of the crowd, and loathed my high marks inlessons and deportment, and the concerts to which I was sent by myaunt, and the exhibitions of my musical skill that I had to givebefore admiring ladies. Whether or not such an experience is typicalof handicapped children, there is tragedy there for those situated asI was. For had I been a little weaker physically, I should have beenthrown back on reading omnivorously and cultivating my music, withsome possible results; while if I had been a little stronger, I couldhave participated in the play on an equal footing with the rest. As itwas, I simply tantalized myself, and grew up with a deepening sense offailure, and a lack of pride in that at which I really excelled.When the world became one of dances and parties and social evenings andboy-and-girl attachments,--the world of youth,--I was to find myselfstill less adapted to it. And this was the harder to bear because I wasnaturally sociable, and all these things appealed tremendously to me.This world of admiration and gayety and smiles and favors and quickinterest and companionship, however, is only for the well-begottenand the debonair. It was not through any cruelty or dislike, I think,that I was refused admittance; indeed they were always very kindabout inviting me. But it was more as if a ragged urchin had beenasked to come and look through the window at the light and warmth ofa glittering party; I was truly in the world, but not of the world.Indeed there were times when one would almost prefer conscious crueltyto this silent, unconscious, gentle oblivion. And this is the tragedy,I suppose, of all the ill-favored and unattractive to a greater or lessdegree; the world of youth is a world of so many conventions, and theabnormal in any direction is so glaringly and hideously abnormal.Although it took me a long time to understand this, and I continuedto attribute my failure mostly to my own character, trying hard tocompensate for my physical deficiencies by skill and cleverness, Isuffered comparatively few pangs, and got much better adjusted to thisworld than to the other. For I was older, and I had acquired a livelyinterest in all the social politics; I would get so interested inwatching how people behaved, and in sizing them up, that only at rareintervals would I remember that I was really having no hand in thegame. This interest just in the ways people are human, has become moreand more a positive advantage in my life, and has kept sweet many asituation that might easily have cost me a pang. Not that a person withdisabilities should be a sort of detective, evil-mindedly using hissocial opportunities for spying out and analyzing his friends’ foibles,but that, if he does acquire an interest in people quite apart fromtheir relation to him, he may go into society with an easy conscienceand a certainty that he will be entertained and possibly entertaining,even though he cuts a poor enough social figure. He must simply notexpect too much.Perhaps the bitterest struggles of the handicapped man come when hetackles the business world. If he has to go out for himself to lookfor work, without fortune, training, or influence, as I personallydid, his way will indeed be rugged. His disability will work againsthim for any position where he must be much in the eyes of men, and hisgeneral insignificance has a subtle influence in convincing those towhom he applies that he is unfitted for any kind of work. As I havesuggested, his keen sensitiveness to other people’s impressions of himmakes him more than usually timid and unable to counteract that fatalfirst impression by any display of personal force and will. He cannotget his personality over across that barrier. The cards seem stackedagainst him from the start. With training and influence somethingmight be done, but alone and unaided his case is almost hopeless. Theattitude toward him ranges from, “You can’t expect us to create a placefor you,” to, “How could it enter your head that we should find any usefor you?” He is discounted at the start: it is not business to makeallowances for anybody; and while people are not cruel or unkind, it isthe hopeless finality of the thing that fills one’s heart with despair.The environment of a big city is perhaps the worst possible that aman in such a situation could have. For the thousands of seemingopportunities lead one restlessly on and on, and keep one’s mindperpetually unsettled and depressed. There is a poignant mental torturethat comes with such an experience,--the urgent need, the repeatedfailure, or rather the repeated failure even to obtain a chance tofail, the realization that those at home can ill afford to have youidle, the growing dread of encountering people,--all this is somethingthat those who have never been through it can never realize. PersonallyI know of no particular way of escape. One can expect to do little byone’s own unaided efforts. I solved my difficulties only by evadingthem, by throwing overboard some of my responsibility, and taking thedesperate step of entering college on a scholarship. Desultory workis not nearly so humiliating when one is using one’s time to someadvantage, and college furnishes an ideal environment where the thingsat which a man handicapped like myself can succeed really count. One’sself-respect can begin to grow like a weed.For at the bottom of all the difficulties of a man like me is reallythe fact that his self-respect is so slow in growing up. Accustomedfrom childhood to being discounted, his self-respect is not naturallyvery strong, and it would require pretty constant success in acongenial line of work really to confirm it. If he could only moreeasily separate the factors that are due to his physical disabilityfrom those that are due to his weak will and character, he mightmore quickly attain self-respect, for he would realize what he isresponsible for, and what he is not. But at the beginning he rarelymakes allowances for himself; he is his own severest judge. He longsfor a “strong will,” and yet the experience of having his effortspromptly nipped off at the beginning is the last thing on earth toproduce that will.If the handicapped youth is brought into harsh and direct touch withthe real world, life proves a much more complex thing to him than tothe ordinary man. Many of his inherited platitudes vanish at the firsttouch. Life appears to him as a grim struggle, where ability does notnecessarily mean opportunity and success, nor piety sympathy, and wherehelplessness cannot count on assistance and kindly interest. Humanaffairs seem to be running on a wholly irrational plan, and successto be founded on chance as much as on anything. But if he can standthe first shock of disillusionment, he may find himself enormouslyinterested in discovering how they actually do run, and he will wantto burrow into the motives of men, and find the reasons for the crassinequalities and injustices of the world he sees around him. He haspractically to construct anew a world of his own, and explain a greatmany things to himself that the ordinary person never dreams of findingunintelligible at all. He will be filled with a profound sympathyfor all who are despised and ignored in the world. When he has beenthrough the neglect and struggles of a handicapped and ill-favored manhimself, he will begin to understand the feelings of all the horde ofthe unpresentable and the unemployable, the incompetent and the ugly,the queer and crotchety people who make up so large a proportion ofhuman folk.We are perhaps too prone to get our ideas and standards of worth fromthe successful, without reflecting that the interpretations of lifewhich patriotic legend, copy-book philosophy, and the sayings of thewealthy give us, are pitifully inadequate for those who fall behind inthe race. Surely there are enough people to whom the task of making adecent living and maintaining themselves and their families in theirsocial class, or of winning and keeping the respect of their fellows,is a hard and bitter task, to make a philosophy gained through personaldisability and failure as just and true a method of appraising the lifearound us as the cheap optimism of the ordinary professional man. Andcertainly a kindlier, for it has no shade of contempt or disparagementabout it.It irritates me as if I had been spoken of contemptuously myself, tohear people called “common” or “ordinary,” or to see that deadly anddelicate feeling for social gradations crop out, which so many of ourupper middle-class women seem to have. It makes me wince to hear a manspoken of as a failure, or to have it said of one that he “doesn’tamount to much.” Instantly I want to know why he has not succeeded, andwhat have been the forces that have been working against him. He isthe truly interesting person, and yet how little our eager-pressing,on-rushing world cares about such aspects of life, and how hideouslythough unconsciously cruel and heartless it usually is!Often I had tried in argument to show my friends how much ofcircumstance and chance go to the making of success; and when I reachedthe age of sober reading, a long series of the works of radical socialphilosophers, beginning with Henry George, provided me with thematerials for a philosophy which explained why men were miserable andoverworked, and why there was on the whole so little joy and gladnessamong us,--and which fixed the blame. Here was suggested a goal, and adefinite glorious future, toward which all good men might work. My ownworking hours became filled with visions of how men could be broughtto see all that this meant, and how I in particular might work somegreat and wonderful thing for human betterment. In more recent years,the study of history and social psychology and ethics has made thosecrude outlines sounder and more normal, and brought them into a sanerrelation to other aspects of life and thought, but I have not lost thefirst glow of enthusiasm, nor my belief in social progress as the firstright and permanent interest for every thinking and true-hearted man orwoman.I am ashamed that my experience has given me so little chance to countin any way either toward the spreading of such a philosophy or towarddirect influence and action. Nor do I yet see clearly how I shall beable to count effectually toward this ideal. Of one thing I am sure,however: that life will have little meaning for me except as I amable to contribute toward some such ideal of social betterment, ifnot in deed, then in word. For this is the faith that I believe weneed to-day, all of us,--a truly religious belief in human progress,a thorough social consciousness, an eager delight in every sign andpromise of social improvement, and best of all, a new spirit of couragethat will dare. I want to give to the young men whom I see,--who, withfine intellect and high principles, lack just that light of the futureon their faces that would give them a purpose and meaning in life,--tothem I want to give some touch of this philosophy, that will energizetheir lives, and save them from the disheartening effects of thatpoisonous counsel of timidity and distrust of human ideals which poursout in steady stream from reactionary press and pulpit.It is hard to tell just how much of this philosophy has been due tohandicap. If it is solely to that that I owe its existence, the pricehas not been a heavy one to pay. For it has given me something that Ishould not know how to be without. For, however gained, this radicalphilosophy has not only made the world intelligible and dynamic tome, but has furnished me with the strongest spiritual support. I knowthat many people, handicapped by physical weakness and failure, findconsolation and satisfaction in a very different sort of faith,--inan evangelical religion, and a feeling of close dependence on Godand close communion with him. But my experience has made my ideal ofcharacter militant rather than long-suffering.I very early experienced a revulsion against the rigid Presbyterianismin which I had been brought up,--a purely intellectual revulsion, Ibelieve, because my mind was occupied for a long time afterwards withtheological questions, and the only feeling that entered into it was asort of disgust at the arrogance of damning so great a proportion ofthe human race. I read T. W. Higginson’s “The Sympathy of Religions”with the greatest satisfaction, and attended the Unitarian churchwhenever I could slip away. This faith, while it still appeals to me,seems at times a little too static and refined to satisfy me withcompleteness. For some time there was a considerable bitterness in myheart at the narrowness of the people who could still find comfort inthe old faith. Reading Buckle and Oliver Wendell Holmes gave me a newcontempt for “conventionality,” and my social philosophy still furthertortured me by throwing the burden for the misery of the world on thesesame good neighbors. And all this, although I think I did not make anuisance of myself, made me feel a spiritual and intellectual isolationin addition to my more or less effective physical isolation.Happily these days are over. The world has righted itself, and I havebeen able to appreciate and realize how people count in a social andgroup capacity as well as in an individual and personal one, and toseparate the two in my thinking. Really to believe in human naturewhile striving to know the thousand forces that warp it from its idealdevelopment,--to call for and expect much from men and women, and notto be disappointed and embittered if they fall short,--to try to dogood with people rather than to them,--this is my religion on its humanside. And if God exists, I think that He must be in the warm sun, inthe kindly actions of the people we know and read of, in the beautifulthings of art and nature, and in the closeness of friendships. He mayalso be in heaven, in life, in suffering, but it is only in thesesimple moments of happiness that I feel Him and know that He is there.Death I do not understand at all. I have seen it in its crudest, mostirrational forms, where there has seemed no excuse, no palliation. Ihave only known that if we were more careful, and more relentless infighting evil, if we knew more of medical science, such things wouldnot be. I know that a sound body, intelligent care and training,prolong life, and that the death of a very old person is neither sadnor shocking, but sweet and fitting. I see in death a perpetual warningof how much there is to be known and done in the way of human progressand betterment. And equally, it seems to me, is this true of disease.So all the crises and deeper implications of life seem inevitably tolead back to that question of social improvement, and militant learningand doing.This, then, is the goal of my religion,--the bringing of fuller, richerlife to more people on this earth. All institutions and all works thatdo not have this for their object are useless and pernicious. Andthis is not to be a mere philosophic precept which may well be buriedunder a host of more immediate matter, but a living faith, to permeateone’s thought, and transfuse one’s life. Prevention must be the methodagainst evil. To remove temptation from men, and to apply the stimuluswhich shall call forth their highest endeavors,--these seem to me theonly right principles of ethical endeavor. Not to keep waging theage-long battle with sin and poverty, but to make the air around menso pure that foul lungs cannot breathe it,--this should be our noblestreligious aim.Education, knowledge and training,--I have felt so keenly my lackof these things that I count them as the greatest of means towardmaking life noble and happy. The lack of stimulus has tended with meto dissipate the power which might otherwise have been concentratedin some one productive direction. Or perhaps it was the many weakstimuli that constantly incited me and thus kept me from following oneparticular bent. I look back on what seems a long waste of intellectualpower, time frittered away in groping and moping, which might easilyhave been spent constructively. A defect in one of the physical sensesoften means a keener sensitiveness in the others, but it seems thatunless the sphere of action that the handicapped man has is very muchnarrowed, his intellectual ability will not grow in compensation forhis physical defects. He will always feel that, had he been strong oreven successful, he would have been further advanced intellectually,and would have attained greater command over his powers. For his mindtends to be cultivated extensively, rather than intensively. He has somany problems to meet, so many things to explain to himself, that heacquires a wide rather than a profound knowledge. Perhaps eventually,by eliminating most of these interests as practicable fields, he maytie himself down to one line of work; but at first he is pretty aptto find his mind rebellious. If he is eager and active, he will geta smattering of too many things, and his imperfect, badly trainedorganism will make intense application very difficult.Now that I have talked a little of my philosophy of life, particularlyabout what I want to put into it, there is something to be said alsoof its enjoyment, and what I may hope to get out of it. I have saidthat my ideal of character was militant rather than long-suffering.It is true that my world has been one of failure and deficit,--I haveaccomplished practically nothing alone, and until my college life freedme could count only two or three instances where I had received kindlycounsel and suggestion; moreover it still seems a miracle to me thatmoney can be spent for anything beyond the necessities without beingfirst carefully weighed and pondered over,--but it has not been aworld of suffering and sacrifice, my health has been almost criminallyperfect in the light of my actual achievement, and life has appearedto me, at least since my more pressing responsibilities were removed,as a challenge and an arena, rather than a vale of tears. I do notlike the idea of helplessly suffering one’s misfortunes, of passivelybearing one’s lot. The Stoics depress me. I do not want to look on mylife as an eternal making the best of a bad bargain. Granting all thecircumstances, admitting all my disabilities, I want too to “warm bothhands before the fire of life.” What satisfactions I have, and they aremany and precious, I do not want to look on as compensations, but aspositive goods.The difference between what the strongest of the strong and the mostwinning of the attractive can get out of life, and what I can, is afterall so slight. Our experiences and enjoyments, both his and mine, areso infinitesimal compared with the great mass of possibilities; andthere must be a division of labor. If he takes the world of physicalsatisfactions and of material success, I at least can occupy the farricher kingdom of mental effort and artistic appreciation. And on theside of what we are to put into life, although I admit that achievementon my part will be harder relatively to encompass than on his, at leastI may have the field of artistic creation and intellectual achievementfor my own. Indeed, as one gets older, the fact of one’s disabilitiesfades dimmer and dimmer away from consciousness. One’s enemy is nowone’s own weak will, and the struggle is to attain the artistic idealone has set.But one must have grown up, to get this attitude. And that is the bestthing the handicapped man can do. Growing up will have given him one ofthe greatest satisfactions of his life, and certainly the most durableone. It will mean at least that he is out of the woods. Childhood hasnothing to offer him; youth little more. They are things to be gottenthrough with as soon as possible. For he will not understand, and hewill not be understood. He finds himself simply a bundle of chaoticimpulses and emotions and ambitions, very few of which, from the natureof the case, can possibly be realized or satisfied. He is bound to beat cross-grains with the world, and he has to look sharp that he doesnot grow up with a bad temper and a hateful disposition, and becomecynical and bitter against those who turn him away. But grown up, hishorizon will broaden; he will get a better perspective, and will nottake the world so seriously as he used to, nor will failure frightenhim so much. He can look back and see how inevitable it all was, andunderstand how precarious and problematic even the best regulated ofhuman affairs may be. And if he feels that there were times when heshould have been able to count upon the help and kindly counsel ofrelatives and acquaintances who remained dumb and uninterested, he willnot put their behavior down as proof of the depravity of human nature,but as due to an unfortunate blindness which it will be his work toavoid in himself by looking out for others when he has the power.When he has grown up, he will find that people of his own age andexperience are willing to make those large allowances for what is outof the ordinary, which were impossible to his younger friends, andthat grown-up people touch each other on planes other than the purelysuperficial. With a broadening of his own interests, he will findhimself overlapping other people’s personalities at new points, andwill discover with rare delight that he is beginning to be understoodand appreciated,--at least to a greater degree than when he had tokeep his real interests hid as something unusual. For he will begin tosee in his friends, his music and books, and his interest in peopleand social betterment, his true life; many of his restless ambitionswill fade gradually away, and he will come to recognize all the moreclearly some true ambition of his life that is within the range ofhis capabilities. He will have built up his world, and have siftedout the things that are not going to concern him, and participationin which will only serve to vex and harass him. He may well come tocount his disabilities even as a blessing, for it has made impossibleto him at last many things in the pursuit of which he would onlyfritter away his time and dissipate his interest. He must not thinkof “resigning himself to his fate”; above all, he must insist on hisown personality. For once really grown up, he will find that he hasacquired self-respect and personality. Grown-upness, I think, is not amere question of age, but of being able to look back and understand andfind satisfaction in one’s experience, no matter how bitter it may havebeen.So to all the handicapped and the unappreciated, I would say,--Grow upas fast as you can. Cultivate the widest interests you can, and cherishall your friends. Cultivate some artistic talent, for you will findit the most durable of satisfactions, and perhaps one of the surestmeans of livelihood as well. Achievement is, of course, on the knees ofthe gods; but you will at least have the thrill of trial, and, afterall, not to try is to fail. Taking your disabilities for granted, andassuming constantly that they are being taken for granted, make yoursocial intercourse as broad and as constant as possible. Do not takethe world too seriously, nor let too many social conventions oppressyou. Keep sweet your sense of humor, and above all do not let anymorbid feelings of inferiority creep into your soul. You will findyourself sensitive enough to the sympathy of others, and if you do notfind people who like you and are willing to meet you more than halfway,it will be because you have let your disability narrow your vision andshrink up your soul. It will be really your own fault, and not that ofyour circumstances. In a word, keep looking outward; look out eagerlyfor those things that interest you, for people who will interest youand be friends with you, for new interests and for opportunities toexpress yourself. You will find that your disability will come to havelittle meaning for you, that it will begin to fade quite completely outof your sight; you will wake up some fine morning and find yourself,after all the struggles that seemed so bitter to you, really and trulyadjusted to the world.I am perhaps not yet sufficiently out of the wilderness to utter allthese brave words. For, I must confess, I find myself hopelesslydependent on my friends and my environment. My friends have come tomean more to me than almost anything else in the world. If it is farharder work to make friendships quickly, at least friendships oncemade have a depth and intimacy quite beyond ordinary attachments. Fora man such as I am has little prestige; people do not feel the need ofimpressing him. They are genuine and sincere, talk to him freely aboutthemselves, and are generally far less reticent about revealing theirreal personality and history and aspirations. And particularly is thisso in friendships with young women. I have found their friendships themost delightful and satisfying of all. For all that social conventionthat insists that every friendship between a young man and woman mustbe on a romantic basis is necessarily absent in our case. There isno fringe around us to make our acquaintance anything but a charmingcompanionship. With all my friends, the same thing is true. The firstbarrier of strangeness broken down, our interest is really in eachother, and not in what each is going to think of the other, how he isto be impressed, or whether we are going to fall in love with eachother. When one of my friends moves away, I feel as if a great holehad been left in my life. There is a whole side of my personality thatI cannot express without him. I shudder to think of any change thatwill deprive me of their constant companionship. Without friends Ifeel as if even my music and books and interests would turn stale onmy hands. I confess that I am not grown up enough to get along withoutthem.But if I am not yet out of the wilderness, at least I think I see theway to happiness. With health and a modicum of achievement, I shallnot see my lot as unenviable. And if misfortune comes, it will onlybe something flowing from the common lot of men, not from my ownparticular disability. Most of the difficulties that flow from thatI flatter myself I have met by this time of my twenty-fifth year,have looked full in the face, have grappled with, and find in no wiseso formidable as the world usually deems them,--no bar to my realambitions and ideals.  THE END  The Riverside Press  CAMBRIDGE .

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes aconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep upwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locationswhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SENDDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particularstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donateWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where wehave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibitionagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states whoapproach us with offers to donate.International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot makeany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received fromoutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donationmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of otherways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. Todonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donateSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic worksProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the ProjectGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could befreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced anddistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network ofvolunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright inthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do notnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paperedition.Most people start at our website which has the main PG searchfacility: www.gutenberg.orgThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
